 misleading funny put place standard wind turbine claim lower amount power comparing turbine sounds comparing year wind turbine similar height 
 heres issue wind turbines feet tall close 
 produce megawatts hundreds watts killawatts
 doubling amount turbines space lowers amount usable land farmers complaint standard wind turbines
 doubling amount doubles amount power distribution required big cost owners 
 reason wind turbines taller bigger blades price megawatt production lowered design cheap requires increasing price megawatt match conventional wind turbines 
 developing countries purchase decomissioned turbines developing countries
