Hello, u/AlekseyP . I am a field technician working for Comcast. I wanted to make a few suggestions.

First off, I doubt that any of your equipment itself is the problem, especially if you're savvy enough to set something like this up. In that case, there are a few things that could be the problem.

First off, and most likely, is a line problem in the drop or in the house. Typically, this sort of issue would be because of what we call ""ingress"", which means that outside RF is somehow getting into our cable system and feeding back on the same frequencies we use for upstream (aka, the frequencies that the modem uses to talk to the CMTS). This interference would most certainly affect your speeds, as the modem would have a much harder time effectively communicating with the headend. 

Right along the same lines, if there is a kink or a nick in the cable, or a loose fitting, or just cheap cable, it could also cause an impedance mismatch in the cable. Our plant is built around a 75 Ohms resistance. When a part of the cable experiences a higher resistance, it cause the RF signal to bounce around inside the cable, which causes distortion of the signal. However, this would be a **constant** issue, rather than being intermittent.

Another possibility would be that there is a signal level issue. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as having a long drop without the benefit of RG11, or because of an issue at the tap, or because of having too many outlets in the house without having an amp. Signal levels fluctuate quite a bit between lower and higher temperatures, and if there is water in either the tap or the drop, then moisture would also cause quite a variation in signal level, which could account for the intermittent nature of the issue you're having.

Lastly, having the correct modem is going to make a big difference. If you are using an Xfinity provided modem, please look at the lights on the front to determine what kind of modem you have. If your modem has 2 wifi lights, then you have the correct equipment. If it only has 1 wifi light, then you need to call up and get an XB3 sent to your home. The difference is in the number of docsis channels that your modem can lock onto. The modem with 1 wifi light can only lock onto 8 docsis channels at a time, which limits its speeds. I've only ever seen these modems get up to a maximum of ~90mbps. The modem with 2 wifi lights, the XB3, can lock on to a maximum of 24 docsis channels, and can easily support 150+mbps. 

If, however, you have your own modem, that you purchased, I would recommend looking online to determine the maximum amount of docsis channels it can lock onto. You should have a modem that can lock on to at least 16 channels if you want to take full advantage of your speeds.

The issue you describe sounds like one of two issues to me. If I were to have an appt for a trouble call for your issue, the first thing I would check would be to see if you have the best modem for your speeds. Assuming you do, the next thing I would do would be to go out to the tap, disconnect your drop, and test for ingress at that point, and I bet that's exactly what it would be.

Ingress is very interesting. It can be caused by a number of things, whether it be a loose fitting, a nick in the cable, or just old, cheap or corroded cable. Quality cable that is properly prepped and fitted is made **specifically** to keep outside RF out, and inside RF in, and it does this with it's shielding. We use high quality tri-shield cable, with compression style F-connectors. As the cable ages, as it takes a beating from the elements, the effectiveness of the shielding is compromised. At that point, outside RF is able to leak in, causing issues. Outside RF is generated by things like cell phones, FM and AM radio, CB radio, and even electromagnetic hum from things like power lines and power tools.

Please let me know what happens. I really do care, and I'll be happy to help you however I can.

Lastly, if you want to PM me and provide me with an email address I can contact you at, or even a phone number, I will be able to speak more directly with you, and really work on getting you a solution.",191

But let's use that number as a worst case scenario.

>After reaching the 300 GB cap of ""unlimited data"" you will be charged $10 for every extra 50 GB.

So, that 300 GB of data costs Comcast 300 pennies, or $3.  For which you pay anywhere from $50-100 for.  Even accounting for customer service, equipment (that taxpayers paid for, ahem), etc. that still represents an insane markup no matter how you look at it.

But this is a better gauge.

That extra 50 gb costs them 50 cents, or $0.50. For which you pay them $10.  It's the same infrastructure/hardware, customer service, etc.  They don't give you anything more.  Don't change anything at their end.  Nothing at all changes whatsoever for delivering you 300 GB or 350 GB.

**Therefore, that 50 GB is sold to you at a 2,000% (aka 20x) markup at a minimum.**

9293 :: Leak of Comcast documents detailing the coming data caps and what you...,"So let me get this right.

Their talking points specifically say ""This is not a data cap and we do not limit a customer's use of the Internet in any way above 300 GB"".  

But they have a program called the ""Unlimited Data Option"".  If that program is Unlimited, doesn't that mean that their default program is, by definition, *limited*?

And who the fuck in their right minds would even consider that ""flexible data option""?   I can't even see how this kind of program is in any way ""fair"" to the consumer.  You have to cut your usage of the internet by more than 98% to qualify for a $5 reduction, and if you go one byte over that, not only do you not get the reduction, you get the privilege of paying them an amount so large it makes a mafia shakedown seem tame by comparison.  

At least they stopped trying to blame this on ""congestion"".   But to say that this is in the interest of ""fairness"" is laughable since there's not a single solitary benefit to the consumer.  A plan of ""If you use more than the X GB allotment, you will be billed an extra $10 per 50 GB.  If you use less than the X GB allotment, you will be credited $10 for every 50 GB that is unused"" would be a hell of a lot more fair than this crap.  (I'm not endorsing that plan, btw.  Just saying at least there's the potential benefit to the consumer who really does do nothing more than Facebook and Email and probably barely cracks 50 GB a month.)

The whole thing is sickening.  But they'll probably get away with it because (A) they have monopoly control in most areas they're pulling this shit in, (B) it's nearly impossible for consumers to do anything about it, and (C) even if it does make its way through the courts, the case would take *years*, and Comcast would likely just walk away with a fine that's pennies compared to the obscene profits they'd be pulling in.

Dear FCC,

As I’m sure you are aware, Comcast has recently announced plans to begin enforcing a 300Gb data cap on a great part of it’s customer base.  I find this change extremely concerning as I see no reason  other companies won’t start following suit.  Natural monopolies, limited options, and shady contracts make it difficult or impossible for myself and many others to reasonably switch to another provider.

I’m asking you to do everything in your power to stop this trend before it starts.  The internet is not just a luxury anymore - it is a critical part of many people’s lives. As we’ve seen with cell phone data, once caps are in place, it is a race to the bottom to offer ever more limited data at ever increasing prices.

"9025 :: Comcast failed to install Internet for 10 months then demanded $60,00...","You'd better believe that this kind of thing wouldn't happen if Comcast was regulated like a public utility or more competition was allowed in the marketplace. 

Either the PUC would require that Comcast provide service within a reasonable amount of time as they do with gas, electric, and water utilities, or another company with comparable service would step in to fill the gap. Unfortunately, current market structure and regulations prevent both of those things. 

In fact, an older post of mine is very relevant to this topic. See it below the line. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The market is structured in such a way as to give them (telecoms) an unfair advantage. 

Let me be clear. There are definitive economic benefits in allowing a company with incredibly high infrastructure costs to have a monopoly over a service area. In economics this is called [Natural Monopoly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). This prevents the duplication of efforts, and allows for a more efficient use of resources, avoiding [problems like this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2_HclPN8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/lgpoxpq2odq4bdbqaf3x.jpg) and [this](http://www.uh.edu/engines/nycandwires.jpg) (early 20th century NYC), where countless companies have overlapping, redundant infrastructure. 

Due to the market power this gives a company, they must also be heavily regulated in order to prevent them from taking advantage of their customers. The alternative is to allow governments to take on this function for themselves. 

The thing is, all water, gas, and electric utilities are heavily regulated by state and federal agencies in a way that telecoms are not. The three so-called ""public"" utilities are seen as necessities for life, while telecom has only recently begun to be viewed that way. As a result, public utilities cannot charge excessive fees for service, and in exchange we give them a near-monopoly over their service territory.

In California, for example, regulatory requirements only allow gas and electric utilities to make money on capital investments. This gives utilities a direct incentive to invest in new infrastructure, because that's how they make money. This simultaneously removes any incentive to overcharge per kWh or to induce customers to use more electricity - even if they did, California utilities wouldn't make any additional money from this practice. 

Instead, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) authorizes a certain rate of return - usually a 5%-10% markup on base electricity cost - based on capital investments and how well the utility runs its business. (Bit of an oversimplification here - this is called ""decoupling"" if you want to look for more details.)

*If we had a policy like that for telecoms, you can bet it would be cheaper and bandwidth would be higher.*

What's more, most states don't restrict a city's right to establish a utility for water, gas, or electric. So why do we do that for telecoms? 

Telecoms, meanwhile, are given the same preferential access to service territories in most states, but are not subject to the same price controls. They exploit this advantage by charging unreasonable prices, lagging behind in infrastructure investment and in providing higher bandwidth, and instituting datacaps that, by Comcast's own admission, are there exclusively to pad the bottom line (see [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151001/05131832403/as-comcast-broadband-usage-caps-expand-company-still-refuses-to-admit-they-even-have-caps.shtml), [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml), and [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150814/12144431948/comcast-admits-broadband-usage-caps-are-cash-grab-not-engineering-necessity.shtml) for details). 

If we're going to allow a company monopolistic control over a service territory, we can't also allow them carte blanche with their price structure. Basic economics says they'll abuse the privilege, and *that's exactly what they've done.*

This is one of many examples of what we economists would call a market failure. Part of the problem is the way the regulatory agencies view telecom. It needs to be considered a necessity and regulated in the same manner as a public utility. Recent changes at the FCC have moved in the right direction, but there's a lot further to go. 

Sources: I have a [M.S. in Ag and Resource Econ](http://i.imgur.com/vdJAsWQ.jpg?1) and worked for Pacific Gas & Electric. 

**TL;DR:** In a modern, 21st century economy, telecom access is a necessity, just like electric, water, and gas, and should be regulated as such. When you allow a company to have unfettered control over a service area without also regulating their business practices and cost structure, the customers (read: everyone) lose.  

There are other alternatives to publicly regulated monopolies, as well, such as increased competition (which would require more regulations to reduce entry barriers) or publicly owned utilities such as the municipal broadband in Chattanooga, TN. These are also perfectly valid solutions to this problem, but it all comes back to natural monopolies in the end. ",1295

If you get paged you have 15min to log in wherever you are day or night, or you could lose your job. I asked how was I supposed to buy groceries or go to get gas or whatever.

My CAG username is ""kunai."" You can just follow from that page and also see other crazy epic scores I've made. (Like the insane ""Get any 5 games for $5 each"" Blockbuster promo).

------

Back in the day (2007/2008) I found a major flaw in the POS at Blockbuster

Their system would update overnight, but only certain parts, and these parts were on different days of the week. Their new item prices would update on Thursday, their used prices would update on Friday- BUT their trade-in values would update after closing on Sunday.

This meant if a game dropped in MSRP, it's new version would first lower on Thursday morning ($49.99 to $19.99) and be cheaper than the used version. The next day, on Friday morning, it's used version would be lowered ($47.99 to $17.99).

The trade-in value would still be the same- usually $30-$35, even though you could pull the game off the rack, buy it for $20, then trade in back without leaving the line.

I did this a few times and felt bad so I emailed corporate to let them know about the loophole. They told me they didn't take in information/suggestions from outside parties, essentially because they had that set up as part of their ""business strategy.""

I then proceeded to assist them in their endeavors by buying 25+ copies of Beowulf from Best Buy for $9.99 ($19.99-$10 coupon) and trading them in for ~$800 in store credit.

Then I repurchased all 25 copies with the store credit for ~$500.

Then I traded them in again.

Then I bought them again.

I did this a few times over the weekend and ended up with $1200 in store credit from $250 cash. 

Then I found a few games GameStop gave good money for and traded them in over there for store credit. I made some preorder and eventually canceled them and requested cash back for the deposit.

I eventually got a letter from Blockbuster banning me from trading, but it had the wrong date (post dated for the next year) and I kept trading.

I don't feel bad about it.",3565

"8578 :: Man finds vulnerability in Starbucks's gift card system, responsibly ...","Funny story; there is this cute little buffer overflow in all the Call of Duty games since MW2 due to the developers copypasting the code for each new game.

Each time they just tell me to contact tech support, tech support forwards me to some senior tech support which basically says ""we are tech support, we can't fix any bugs"". When I explain the severity they just disconnect and ignore any further messages.

So a few months ago some, not necessarily bad, people in a steam/CoD modding group found out about it independently and used it to gain access to some server hosting company which let them leak a lot of files and debug symbols for some games.

Naturally Activision wasn't too happy about it and two months later they patched the most recent games. The slightly older titles like MW2 and MW3 are still vulnerable 5 months down the road. I've tried to tell them that it's not fixed yet but, like mentioned above, when disclosing information they just say that it's not their problem.

Speaking of Activision, do not try to help them, if you do then they'll send lawyers after you for violating their copyright rather than fixing it; http://puu.sh/hJyMj/af875ab002.png http://puu.sh/hSyDb/2213d71d9e.png",211

**mandatory creation of laws against music piracy**

Without prejudice to Articles 11(1)(ii), 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), 11ter(1)(ii), 14(1)(ii), and14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, each Party shall provide to authors the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them71.

**Criminal prosecutions for Movie Piracy (sounds like it is targeted at the original ""copier/cammer"")**

4. Recognizing the need to address the unauthorized copying140 of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognizing the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and  penalties.

"8507 :: TPP leaked: final draft of the intellectual property chapter, which s...","**Here are some highlights after reading through it. Items in [ ] are written by me.**

Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied
where any person is found to have engaged willfully and for purposes of
commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the above activities

for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary... the
publisher is the designated right holder in such work

In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 2, its judicial authorities
shall have the authority to consider, inter alia, any legitimate measure of value the right
holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services
measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price. [Damages aren't tied to the value of the item]

In civil judicial proceedings, with respect to infringement of copyright or related
rights protecting works... each Party shall establish or
maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:
(a) pre-established damages, which shall be available upon the election of the
right holder; or
(b) additional damages ( For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages.) [This clears the way for, but doesn't require, cash settlements in addition to the value of the copyrighted work.] 

Pre-established damages under paragraphs (7) and (8) shall be set out in an amount
that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the
infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements

In awarding additional damages under paragraphs (7) and (8), judicial authorities
shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider appropriate,
having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the infringing conduct and the
need to deter similar infringements in the future

judicial authorities
shall, at least, have the authority to:
(a) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody
of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited
activity;

A Party may provide that damages shall not be available against a nonprofit library,
archives, educational institution, museum, or public noncommercial broadcasting entity that sustains the burden of proving that such entity was not aware or had no reason to
believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity

Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least
in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a
commercial scale. In respect of willful copyright or related rights piracy, “on a commercial
scale” includes at least:
(a) acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and
(b) significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain,
that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or
related rights owner in relation to the marketplace.

With respect to the offenses for which this Article requires the Parties to provide
for criminal procedures and penalties, Parties shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding
and abetting is available under its law.

Where a Party requires the identification of items subject to seizure as a
prerequisite for issuing any such judicial order, that Party shall not require
the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them
for the purpose of seizure. [A lot of stuff like this. Making sure that the process for suing is easy and can be done without much evidence]

[TRADE SECRETS] 
(c) the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret;
(e) the acts are detrimental to a Party's economic interests, international
relations, or national defense or national security. [It's criminal if it makes the company look bad?]

[ISPs]
limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief
against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements. [Countries must change their laws if they shield ISPs from cash liability for copyright infringement]
referring or linking users to an online location by using information location
tools, including hyperlinks and directories.
[Countries must also change laws that shield hyperlinks from monetary damages] 

Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in
accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process
and privacy, enabling a copyright owner who has made a legally sufficient claim of
copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider
information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, where such
information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing such copyright. [ISPs must hand over user info, this in addition to previous statements deteriorating burdens of proof, is powerful]

"8441 :: Ashley Madison made millions from $19 'full delete' option, which may...","Man, blackmail is a piece of cake in the age of technology. I mean, how many intelligence agencies do you think run compromising websites like Ashley Madison to keep files on potential politicians one day.

You do something sleazy as a 28 year-old, and try to run for Congress as a 52 year-old . . . only to find out that all your embarrassing sexual data is on file (and used to put pressure on you by unsavory interests).

When Barack Obama first became a candidate for senate, the NSA started tapping his phones (and all the phones of anyone who knew him or worked with him. As well as email.). See here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-nsa-spied-on-barack-obama-2004-russ-tice-2013-6

And who can forget Governor Elliot Spitzer who was spied on (using the Patriot Act)? Abusing a law that was ostensibly to go after terrorists, they applied the statute unethically whereby they discovered that the Governor used prostitutes. Once he started opening investigations into Goldman Sachs [prior to the 2008 financial meltdown] that information was leaked to the Press and he was politically neutralized [with all investigations into Wall Street fraud tabled]. Spitzer resigned in shame--and Goldman Sachs went right back to their illegal activities, culminating in the largest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression.

Same thing with Senator Larry Craig. I remember when it was leaked to the press that he was hitting on men in an airport bathroom, and Chris Matthews on MSNBC said, ""This event happened three years ago. Why release it now?""

He very astutely realized that Craig had a ""blackmail file"". That stuff is kept locked up tight in the eventuality that, one day, a politician doesn't vote ""the right way"". Then, and only then, is the information leaked.

My point in all this? It'd be enlightening to see exactly where the seed money came for Ashley Madison. Who funded it? Who gave the creator the startup capital?

(It'd be interesting to trace the money and see if it's like Facebook, with its million connections to the intelligence agencies. And it's worse than just the NSA or the CIA. Intelligence agencies like Israel's Mossad or Britain's MI6 may very well be creating sites with the intention of blackmailing US politicians.)",331

Now that we're stuck with Comcast and their data cap, we only save money by having an Internet and cable tv bundle. We didn't even hook up the cable box because we wouldn't use it, since streaming services is what we preferred.

I *do not* believe that the current political structure has the best interest of its citizens in-mind. I *do* believe that the government needs to be reigned-in in some ways, and a lot of things need to change. It starts with educating ourselves and having non-partisan, attainable goals, and assembling when necessary whether online or in public to make sure that our government serves US and not the other way around.

I am a web developer who has worked for several years with Flash and now HTML5 + Javscript.

Having developed games and applications in both mediums, I have to say that I will definitely be sad if Flash completely dies out. One of the things that drew me to building in Flash was that it was just so easy to pick up. I started out animating crappy sprite movies, and not long afterwards, I started drawing my own art and learning AS2 and AS3.

I think sites like Newgrounds flourished in part because Flash was so easy to start using. Having such accessible animation tools, a built-in coding environment, and a community of people eager to learn and teach each other definitely helped Flash cartoons & games become so prevalent across the net.

Nowadays, I can't say I have the same confidence in HTML5 + JS + Canvas as I did in Flash. Not to say that they can't achieve the same things ([this comment from /u/VeryAngryBeaver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3hvdzg/flash_is_dying_what_about_all_the_webgames/cub43a4) has a good summary of the comparisons between the two mediums today). What I'm saying is, the learning curve is steeper. That easy, inviting start is gone.

When I was learning Flash, all I needed to start with was Flash. Now that I'm doing HTML5 games, I need an image editor, a text editor, a coding environment, and I need to know how to code HTML and Javascript. Not impossible tasks, to be sure, but in combination, difficult enough that if that 14-year-old me tried to pick it up today because I wanted to make my crappy Mario vs. Sonic sprite animation, I can't speak for what other people would do, but I would likely get frustrated and give up.

I do remain optimistic, however, as programs like [Construct](https://www.construct3.com/)  and other HTML5 game building programs become more popular.

I know it's really easy hating on Flash and its many downsides (if a week goes by without the program crashing, I start to get worried), especially on the user-end. I just thought I would chime in from in a different perspective.",284

"7760 :: Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: ""The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Unintere...","""It’s an exciting job. We’re doing a lot behind the scenes that people have not seen yet.""

That is the sentence that worries me. This sounds like she wants to fix reddit through new features. Which, done by of a ceo that did not understand her product or the users using it, will be the thing that hurts reddit the most in the end.",1230
"7760 :: Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: ""The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Unintere...","I've been trying to give her the benefit of the doubt but this comment from Pao demonstrates both:

1. She has no understanding of the business model her own company uses because the vocal minority of Reddit is what produces the content to attract the majority to the site.
2. She is so out of touch with the community that she makes comments like this and doesn't have the wisdom to know that they will not be received well.

The CEO of a company should never make comments like this.  It's self-serving and protectionist.  It lowers yourself into the weeds AND is ultimately harmful to the company (most importantly).  She would have been better off saying nothing from a PR standpoint.

This just builds on the fact that they let a key face of the company go abruptly and unexpectedly without any kind of coordinated message.  This is very basic PR.  If you have a well known employee who you want to terminate (for whatever reason) then you need to have them issue a statement that makes it sound like they're pursuing better opportunity and it was their choice to leave (in exchange for either a golden parachute or not disclosing whatever horrible thing they did depending on the situation).  So it's another case of Chairman Pao is showing incompetence in the basic mechanics of how to run a business.  It's no wonder she didn't make partner at her last job because so far everyone is wondering how she ever got the one she has now.

The big thing that people on the board of Reddit Inc need to understand is that Reddit is what it is because it gets out of the users way and people in turn choose to build vibrant communities on it.  Between the censorship and shadow banning and the desire to control the AMA process so that guests can have pre-screened questions (which would just turn AMA into a CNN interview) the community is upset because we like Reddit and all remember what happened to Digg.  We don't want to see a Voat post in a year saying Reddit has been bought by Dice for an embarrassing amount of money.  

This is a case where the majority of the community that actively makes Reddit a top 100 website is trying to help keep Reddit from making self-destructive decisions.  The board should see this and move to replace Chairman Pao with leadership that understands the company and its business model.",3302

"7760 :: Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: ""The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Unintere...","Here's the thing, she's right, but she is also (probably) fundamentally misunderstanding how a site like reddit works.

I'm going to make up some numbers, disagree with them all you like, but I'm just using them to get to a core idea.

Reddit's key 'value' to those who own it is: Monthly active users, Pageviews. The pageviews are in the billions, the MAU are in the hundreds of millions.

Let's assume: 85% of those MAU are just readers. 10% are commenters. 5% are submitters.

Those are the numbers I made up, and they may not be accurate, but I think they are probably a good overall pattern to judge the site. Most of the folks are totally disinterested in the nitty gritty politics of the site because they are just passive readers. They view reddit as a place for cat memes and interesting news. They come here for the CONTENT and not the IDENTITY.

But here's the problem, that CONTENT is being created by the 15% that comprise the commenters and the submitters. They are ones bringing in the clickbaity titles and the superfresh news and the memes and the pun threads, everything we love about reddit. Those are a more passionate and hardcore crowd, the ones who view reddit as IDENTITY, and those are the ones who are currently frothing for various reasons.

She's right, the 85% probably won't be swayed by everything that's going on and won't leave for political reasons, but what if the 15% is and does?

Without the content, the 85% will leave too. They are here because they are the audience to the cast of performers built of the 15%.  I don't think the admins are viewing the system from that perspective, and if that's true, the site's dead man walking.

The unsecured iOS would allow the FBI to use a ""brute force"" attack on the iPhone, enabling the FBI to bypass the phone's passcode and see the contents on the device. Apple has complied with the FBI as much as they can, but they refuse to comply with the FBI's order to make an unsecured iOS, because doing so and putting it in the hands of the government would essentially create a ""master key"" to unlock iPhones.

I even asked them specifically about a cap, and he said there wasn't one.

He gave me an estimate, and I told him i'll think about it.

Guess who shows up next week with a service turn-up form, AT&T. Not only that, the price they quoted was significantly lower than what I would be charged

They're so adamant about getting sales, they're willing to say anything including, forgetting there are caps, giving incorrect estimates on prices, leaving out install fees, agreement fees, and taxes on the bill.

Of course I didn't take up their offer. I guess i'm lucky to have 60/5 with no cap for $66/month",109

Would the car sense the impending danger and slam on the gas and swerve out of the way to save your life? How smart are these things?

"7322 :: As ISPs Push Harder On Usage Caps, House Pushes Bill Preventing The F...","I wrote this to my Representative. I'm from Michigan and this absurd bill is backed by another Rep from my state, although from a different district. If anyone wants to take this and use it as a template to send to their own Rep I would be proud to have it used.

""I'm writing to inform you of my opposition to H.R. 2666 passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee. I simply don't understand why our representatives, who are supposed to be serving the best interests of their constituents, are against broadband rate regulation by the FCC. The United States lags far behind the rest of the developed world in broadband speed and prices, and not for lack of ability. Many of the ISPs in our country have become fat and greedy, looking solely at maximizing profits and essentially extorting their customers rather than innovating. A friend of mine recently visited Romania on a missions trip, and paid $7 a month for internet vastly superior to what is offered here. Romania is ranked 3rd in the world in internet connection speed! Yet if you asked most people on the street if they thought Romania even had internet they may say they don't.

For example, take a look at the areas that have been recently serviced by Google Fiber. Competing ISPs just happen to find more network capacity and lower their rates at the same time a real competitor rolls into town. The capacity is there, but absent any real competition ISPs don't feel the need to offer fair prices. The many local monopolies that exist are detrimental to the protection of consumers. In my area, there is only one broadband provider: Comcast. Sure, Frontier and AT&T may be available, but they don't offer comparable services. DSL is simply not on the same level as cable or fiber internet offerings. 

Our country needs innovation in how its ISPs are run, and protecting ISPs from the FCC is not the way to do it. The internet is no longer a luxury item, but has become as integral (if not more so) to our daily lives as the telephone. Why is it that consumers should be protected from price gouging in one utility but not another?  

I also find it suspicious that this bill is backed by Rep. Fred Upton - also of Michigan - and that the PAC that funds his campaign receives donations from the likes of AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon. These are all companies that would love to see this bill pass, and all companies that stand to benefit from a lack of price regulation in their industry. All I ask is that you, and other representatives, remember who it is that they are supposed to be representing and protecting.

Thank you.""",130

"7272 :: Birmingham, Ala. has seen a 71% drop in citizen complaints and a 38% ...","Birmingham, Ala. has seen a 71% drop in citizen complaints and a 38% drop in use of force by officers since deploying body cameras two months ago, and costs are **low**.

Let's get real here:

1) Birmingham has a population of 230k, and spends $90m on its police force. So it spends $390 per person per year on the police. And this costs an additional what, $1m per year? (they referenced a $900k package that lasts for 5 years, but whatever, call it $1m per year). You're talking about a roughly 1% increase in costs, or $5 per citizen, for a 70% drop in citizen complaints and 40% drop in use of force. That's fucking cheap, like fucking ridiculously cheap. Can we please put that in the title instead of 'costs are huge'. 

2) And guess what, it's only going to get cheaper as the hardware for actual storage is becoming dirt cheap. They referenced 5 TB, well the retail price per terabyte is $30, that's a retail price for the hardware, you could store 5 TB on $150 worth of hardware. In 10 years it'd be about $10. Add abundant, industry grade storage instead and you're still looking at a few thousand bucks a year tops and that's extremely generous, and again, dropping every year. The big cost factor of course is management/software, and here too I expect price drops (they'll be way above market rate, it's government after all, but nothing near what it is today once more companies enter the market.

3) No business or organisation on the planet talks about costs and nothing but costs. Costs are incurred for a goal, and that goal has profits or cost-savings. Let's look at the financial benefits of cameras, too. Lawsuits that are avoided, trials that can be ended more quickly due to better evidence, as well as the above mentioned examples (drops in citizen complaints, use of force etc). Is it crazy to imagine that if you drop use of force by 40% and citizen complaints by 70%, finish trials faster and avoid lawsuits, that you may get a 1% cost saving? Well if so, the costs have already been compensated for by cost savings.

*Edit: Posted this and came back to a blowed up inbox and some gold (thank you). I'm not talking about casual fans, or big fans of a single sport. I'm talking about big fans of several sports. I'm ~~fairly well versed in~~ aware of streaming services, and if I paid for all the hardware or streaming services needed to watch all the sports I'd like to (particularly MLB, NFL, & college football) I'd be spending about the same amount as I am for cable TV. I was a cord cutter for about 2 years. I went from paying a little over $100/month for cable + internet to paying about $60/month for only internet. It was a whopping $40ish in savings. I then subscribed to netflix, which cut my savings down to $30/month. Last I checked ESPN's streaming service was either $15-$20 ($20 if using Sling TV). Now my savings are down to $10 or $15...and I STILL don't have access to all the sports I want.

On top of all that, cable is MUCH easier and MUCH more reliable when it comes to sports. I'm glad that streaming services are becoming more prevalent, but unless there are options I'm not aware of it's no where close to replacing the value cable provides for sports.",5189

"7092 :: Dell ships laptops with rogue root CA, exactly like what happened wit...","Here's what I did to ameliorate the problem (I have a new XPS 15 that arrived 5 days ago that is infected - fuckers!). Essentially, I created a batch file to remove it and setup a scheduled task to run after each logon. Steps for those that need them:

--creating the batch file:

1. Open the cert manager and note the cert's serial number: follow OP's instructions to locate the cert -> double click the cert -> Details Tab -> serial number should be listed. copy down the hex string of characters as you see them.
2. Create new text file and save it with a .bat extension.
3. Insert the following command:

    certutil -delstore root ""<cert serial number>""    

4. Save the file.

--creating the task to run it at logon:

5. Click open the start menu and type ""Task"", in the results should be ""Task Scheduler"", open it.
6. Follow the instructions [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-administrator-mode-shortcuts-without-uac-prompts-in-windows-vista/) to create a new task, with the following differences:
a. on the General tab, select ""Run with highest privileges""
b. under triggers, where it says ""Begin the task: "", select ""At log on"" from the drop-down.
7. on the Actions tab, click ""new"" and where it says ""Program/script"" browse to the .bat file you created above.
8. click Ok.
9. Test by shutting down and restarting (note: restart does not recreate the issue. You must shut down completely, then wait, then start your PC to fully recreate the test).

Notes: I got a bit paranoid about putting the actual cert serial number in this - I wasn't sure if I'd reveal something specific about my PC. If someone else is sure its safe to post, post your cert serial and I'll update these instructions if it actually matches my cert's serial.

7092 :: It’s official—NSA did keep its e-mail metadata program after it “ende...,"Actual document [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/19/us/20-foia-nsa.html). Cited paragraph (page 65):

> **Other authorities can satisfy certain foreign intelligence requirements that the PR/TT program was designed to meet.** The Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis (SPCMA), which SID implemented widely in late 2010, allows NSA to call-chain from, to, or through U.S. person selectors in Signals Intelligence collection obtained under a number of authorities. In addition, notwithstanding restrictions stemming from the FISC's recent concerns regarding upstream collection, FAA §702 has emerged as another critical source for collection of Internet communications of foreign terrorists. Thus, SPCMA and FAA §702 assist in the identification of terrorists communicating with individuals within the United States, which addresses one of the original reasons for establishing the PR/TT program in 2004.

The headline in the [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/records-show-email-analysis-continued-after-nsa-program-ended.html?_r=0) that Ars Technica cites is accurate, ""File Says N.S.A. Found Way to Replace Email Program"". PR/TT was a domestic email metadata program that was ended in December 2011, and this paragraph says that other authorities, ""Satisfy the requirements it was designed to meet."" Ars Technica interprets, ""Satisfying the requirements,"" as, ""Effective continuing [the program]."" The ""It's Official"" headline is clearly misleading, because the only thing that is official is their not-terribly-charitable interpretation.

First off, everyone should read the actual document. For an organization that has no oversight or compliance, it's over 120 pages of oversight, which details their audit and review of internal NSA controls that protect the data of US persons. They give specific numbers for how many references to US person were found as having been collected incidentally (not to us, it's redacted; to the oversight overlords). On the whole, it shows a lot of compliance for things like RAS, limits on chaining, and minimization of information regarding US persons.

Next, Section 702 is overseas collection of overseas data, targeted at foreign persons. It would be frankly shocking if NSA were not doing this. What Ars Technica is concerned about is that the incidental collection on US persons could be large (the conspiracy theory version is that they're intentionally targeting queries that will bring back large quantities of incidental collection). They provide no evidence that it *is* large, so again, their headline is pretty grossly misleading. All this is really saying is that 702 collection is still happening (it would be negligence if it wasn't), and that NSA seems to be satisfied that they're able to investigate foreigners (when they are overseas) in the course of their terrorism investigations.

7016 :: Reddit in uproar after staff sacking,"I know this will probably be buried, and maybe no one noticed us when we were the reddit vendors, but this situation really mirrors the treatment of vendors/users/reddit employees when reddit shutdown the ""reddit marketplace""

One day my wife and I were running a store that was paying a good portion of our income, my wife having quit her day job partially because of the income from the reddit marketplace and the next the store was gone. All the links to our store now redirected to a list of ""reddit"" merchandise like snoo plushies and stickers, with no mention of the store's closing. I had given most of our customers that address, and now had no way of contacting them. Stickers and business cards we had given our now redirected to a site selling reddit snoo merchandise. Reddit had not only shutdown the marketplace, but hijacked all the traffic to their own stores and pretended we never existed. Customers with existing orders were unable to contact us, and if for example, we had a problem with a customers order, we literally had no way to look it up or refund the client or anything, the entire store's backend was deleted without warning.

These stores used to be used primarily for the gift exchanges such as secret santa. Any posts we made anywhere to tell customers was instantly deleted as ""self promotion"". We were all only allowed to post in a single thread in another subreddit that's primarily for the vendors. One day our stores were being advertised all over reddit, the next we're not allowed to ""self-promote"" by even trying to contact our old customers, we were told it was a violation of the rules to contact customers by email, or use the phrase ""reddit markplace"" anywhere to tell people where we used to do business.

Reddit's management absolutely does not care about destroying communities, they have no concept of loyalty to people who grow these communities or rely on them.

(Edit: OP is u/161719 Thanks to u/Gully_Foyle for that info)

>I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. 

>A few points: 
1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people. 

>Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person. 

>With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad. 

>2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke. 

>3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. 

>Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police. 

>You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there. 

 > 4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?"" 
""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail. 

  >Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons. 

  >You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors. 
 
  >This all happened in the country where I live. 

>  You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality. 

>Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not? 
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety? 

>Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe? 

>I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen. 

>I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

6999 :: Why ‘I Have Nothing to Hide’ Is the Wrong Way to Think About Surveill...,"Something interesting I saw on Reddit about this argument a while ago

'One facet of this argument that goes largely undiscussed (and is something your friend may care about) is that it is bad for an imperfect government to be able to predict all crime. Some of the greatest steps forward in human history were only made possible by people being able to hide information from their government. If the church had access to Galileo's research journals and notes we could be hundreds of years behind in our scientific growth. If the government had unlimited access to the networks of civil dissidents blacks may have never fought off Jim Crow. If King George had perfect information America would never have been a country. There is no government on earth that is perfect, and therefore there is no government on earth that can act responsibly with unlimited access to information. A government is unlikely to be able to distinguish between a negative and positive disruption to it's social order and laws, and it therefore follows that an unlimited spying program can only hinder the next great social step forward. Don't fear the surveillance state because you might have something illegal, fear the surveillance state because it is a tremendous institutional barrier to meaningful societal progress.' - /u/Kim_Jung-Skill",252

We were not required to retain records going back that far, but the only time they had gotten thrown out was when they needed more room for records, and the records room had taken over two entire auto bays in the garage around back of the building.

So, this doesn't surprise me at all.  Whoops, criminals, if you're looking to stay on the down low, /never/ call or hail a cab.",88

I pay 39.99€ for my 50 MBit VDSL (200 MBit with Vectoring coming soon to my area) which includes a flatrate for the telephone, as long as I call landlines and no mobile. With HD TV over VDSL (Telekom Entertain) it would cost 49.99€, but I don't have that booked. With both options I get unlimited data.

My friend in the US pays 120 USD for a 200 MBit line but has a data cap of 350 GB. His only option is Comcast since the other company in Tucson does not serve his area.

From a technical standpoint I can see why DSL might have a bad stand in the US since cities and settlements are so spread out and a lot of people could end up really away from the next DSLAM and only a few would get the speeds advertised, since the speed of DSL is actually dependent on the distance to the DSLAM.

6773 :: Mitsubishi admits cheating fuel efficiency tests,"The models they're talking about are Japan/Asia editions. 

In Japan, cars with engines smaller than a certain size get a different license plate (yellow plate) and are taxed at much lower rates. Some of these cars have engines that are 0.6 L displacement or so. Not sure of the exact cutoff size for this class of vehicles, but it's probably anything less than 1 Liter size. They pay less money when using toll roads as well. 

My car has a 1.4 liter engine and it's extremely fuel efficient. It's got the normal white color plate. I've driven a car with a yellow plate and it didn't really seem like it saved much on gasoline. It was a Terrios Kid, by Daihatsu. I can see why the manufacturers would want to list high fuel efficiency, when competing for a market where a bigger engine sized car might get similar mileage. I'm much happier driving a more powerful car that gets nearly the same fuel economy as these micro cars. These mini cars are easier to park though, lol.",841

"6759 :: Sunny Nevada Just Killed The Solar Industry With 40% Tax Hike, Derail...","I am a solar owner in NV.  I install solar in NV.  I was at the last PUC meeting.  I am getting totally fucked by this and will have to move.  Here are the main issues.

1  NV Energy paid people to install solar.  They needed it at the time to satisfy the mandated amount of renewable energy they needed.  They told us it was a good idea and gave us checks and told us how much we would save.

2  They have decided that they don't need any more solar so they were going to change the rules going forward, but they decided to change it for everyone, even existing systems.

3  They created a bunch of false costs to justify the new numbers.  They ignored the survey they performed in 2014 that found that there was a 36 million dollar savings to non-solar users from their neighbors having solar, and instead referenced nothing.

4  Now they made it so the solar (that they paid you to install) will never cover the costs.  They did this by creating both higher monthly service charges ($15 increasing to $38) and crediting people less for energy fed into the grid (when the system is making more power than is being used at the time).

5 And they are still lying about this on their website.  Here is a link to some correct math  http://newnvelectricrate.com/lets-look-at-the-numbers-given-by-nv-energy/

When I put my system in the calculator, in 2020 my $15,000 3.5kw system will save me $120 a year.  The payback is never going to happen.  Now, when I was incentivized to do this by the people who are changing the rules with no warning, do you think that is fair?

>Dear Colleagues,
 
>It is with great sadness that I write that Ray Tomlinson passed away suddenly on Saturday.
 
>Ray is well known for inventing email and saving the @ sign from obscurity by choosing it to separate the receiver’s name from the host name. Despite creating the most revolutionary communications tool, Ray was always a humble and modest man.  He was interviewed frequently, and often asked the same questions about choosing the @ sign and the proliferation of email.  He always answered patiently and with good humor, whether the interviewer was a noted journalist from NPR, a green reporter from a local paper, or an elementary school student working on a project.  The email story Ray most enjoyed telling is about someone who thanked him for inventing email because it had enabled a family member with a rare disease to communicate with others in similar circumstances scattered around the world.  Ray seemed to find more gratification in connecting those people with a supportive community through email than he did from the numerous awards he earned. 
 
>Ray’s colleagues know that the invention of email represents a small fraction of his many contributions during his 49 years at BBN.  He was one of the four-person team that created TENEX, the first operating system to support virtual memory using paging, wrote one of the first implementations of TCP, and worked on the first object-oriented distributed system. Everyone enjoyed working with Ray, not only because he was a brilliant and imaginative engineer, but because he was also generous with him time and always kind.

> Investigators have also found evidence that in their final days, Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik tried to erase their electronic footprints, another sign of premeditation. They destroyed several electronic devices, including two smashed cellphones found in a trash can near their home, and erased emails, officials said.

> When they were killed, Ms. Malik had what investigators believe might have been a “burner phone,” meant to be used for a short time and discarded, with no social media apps or other identifying information on it. Despite their efforts, the couple’s computers, phones and other electronics provide the best hope for reconstructing their communications and motives.

Hell, even local law enforcement immediately flags mass burner phones as suspicious because they are an effective tool for criminals:

> FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton said Friday the agency had been contacted by local law enforcement officials about the cellphone purchases and also was aware of the propane tank thefts.

> Criminals sometimes use prepaid cellphones to avoid surveillance because the devices can make it harder for investigators to link a phone to a particular person. And terrorists and insurgents have used them in recent years as triggering mechanisms on homemade explosives.

> Local police departments and sheriffs offices in Macon, Lebanon, Jefferson City, Columbia, Cape Girardeau, Jackson and Ava said they received reports of people buying large numbers of cellphones from Wal-Mart stores. Sometimes police talked to the buyers. Sometimes they arrived too late. Such purchases are legal, so there were no arrests.

"6456 :: FCC fines Hilton Hotels $25,000 for stonewalling their inquiries into...","$25,000 might seem like a slap on the wrist, but this is just for obstructing a government probe into their operations.

The total fine could be a lot more once the FCC determines how much Hilton Hotels was gouging customers.  

EDIT:  /u/rekhytkael has a really great explanation for the $25k fine.  I'm going to copy and paste so it gets a little more visibility.

>The FCC has fined Hilton for the obstruction of an investigative probe; a probe which was intended to look into the matter of Hilton jamming personal WiFi hotspots. The fine is purely for obstruction and says nothing of the validity or findings of the probe (which has not been completed).

>$25k is a pitance to a company like Hilton, but the FCC is not authorized to make the fine any larger. The FCC has rules and regulations that are standardized, not subjective. $25k is all that they can levy against Hilton for mere obstruction. At such a point in time when a probe uncovers wrongdoing, the FCC will be free to impose a MUCH larger fine in accordance with the magnitude of the offense.

>Additionally, at such a point in time when wrongdoing is exposed, any number of individuals can attempt to sue> Hilton for arbitrarily high damages (most likely resulting in a class action suit where everyone involved gets a payout of 7 whole dollars).

>The $25k fine is paltry, but it is indicative of things to come as far as lawsuits and fines if wrongdoing is found in further investigations. Combined with the influx of bad publicity, Hilton is looking at some hefty financial losses. In perspective, this article was published yesterday, and Hilton has probably lost far more than $25k in business in the past 24 hours alone.

>TL;DR - It's a fine for obstruction, not for blocking wi-fi.

This was his work phone, which the shooters decided not to smash into pieces like they both did with their personal phones. Does anybody think they just forgot to smash this one too? Or, did the shooter who worked *for the government* assume (rightly) that if he did terroristy things on his work phone that he could have been found out. And that consequently he kept the bad stuff on his personal phone only.

And even if there is something on this phone, let's also not forget that the FBI ruined their legitimate chance of recovering it in the first place. Within a day of the shooting the FBI (before consulting Apple) had the employer IT reset the phone password. This disconnected the phone from iCloud which they otherwise could have used to hack the backup if they brought the phone to the shooter's home WiFi.

So they can argue all they want about how it is not burdensome for Apple to help them, but I think it is idiotic to claim that when *they* are the one's who created the circumstances that they are now in, not Apple.

6443 :: CISPA is back with a new name. Since Congress seems to be stuck in 19...,"I was an intern in a congressional office, this isn't as clever as you think

Our office did have a fax machine, every office did. If we wanted to send a fax we would have to do it via the machine.

But we never received a single fax through the fax machine. When we were sent a fax it would be sent to an email address that I had to manage. I would then go through the email and sort them. Generally, if an email didn't contain a person's full name and mailing address, or if that address wasn't in our district, then it would go straight to the trash. Policy related emails would go to the relevant staffer.

Now, the logic of this next step eludes me but it was procedure. Whenever we got physical mail from a constituent it would be put in a special blue envelope and sent to a place that would turn it into a digital format. That digital mail would then go to the LC, who would draft a response and mail it to the constituent. The digital mail is kept on file and the physical mail is eventually shredded. So making physical mail digital does help us with filing. Here's what I didn't understand, when a fax came in from a CONSTITUENT it would be printed out, and then put in the same envelope with the mail, and converted digitally. Why it has to go from digital to physical back to digital I don't understand.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you plan of spamming your congressman with faxes, they're realistically only going to print out one copy. If you plan on spamming somebody who isn't your congressman then an intern is going to filter it out and nobody else will ever see it.

"6347 :: Comcast’s data caps aren’t just bad for subscribers, they’re bad for ...","This behavior is exactly why Comcast needs to be regulated like a public utility or we need to allow local governments to provide their own  broadband service. 

The market is structured in such a way as to give them (telecoms) an unfair advantage. 

Let me be clear. There are definitive economic benefits in allowing a company with incredibly high infrastructure costs to have a monopoly over a service area. In economics this is called [Natural Monopoly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). This prevents the duplication of efforts, and allows for a more efficient use of resources, avoiding [problems like this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2_HclPN8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/lgpoxpq2odq4bdbqaf3x.jpg) and [this](http://www.uh.edu/engines/nycandwires.jpg) (early 20th century NYC), where countless companies have overlapping, redundant infrastructure. 

Due to the market power this gives a company, they must also be heavily regulated in order to prevent them from taking advantage of their customers. The alternative is to allow governments to take on this function for themselves. 

The thing is, all water, gas, and electric utilities are heavily regulated by state and federal agencies in a way that telecoms are not. The three so-called ""public"" utilities are seen as necessities for life, while telecom has only recently begun to be viewed that way. As a result, public utilities cannot charge excessive fees for service, and in exchange we give them a near-monopoly over their service territory.

In California, for example, regulatory requirements only allow gas and electric utilities to make money on capital investments. This gives utilities a direct incentive to invest in new infrastructure, because that's how they make money. This simultaneously removes any incentive to overcharge per kWh or to induce customers to use more electricity - even if they did, California utilities wouldn't make any additional money from this practice. 

Instead, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) authorizes a certain rate of return - usually a 5%-10% markup on base electricity cost - based on capital investments and how well the utility runs its business. (Bit of an oversimplification here - this is called ""decoupling"" if you want to look for more details.)

*If we had a policy like that for telecoms, you can bet broadband would be cheaper and bandwidth would be higher.*

What's more, most states don't restrict a city's right to establish a utility for water, gas, or electric. So why do we do that for telecoms? 

Telecoms, meanwhile, are given the same preferential access to service territories in most states, but are not subject to the same price controls. They exploit this advantage by charging unreasonable prices, lagging behind in infrastructure investment and in providing higher bandwidth, and instituting datacaps that, by Comcast's own admission, are there exclusively to pad the bottom line (see [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151001/05131832403/as-comcast-broadband-usage-caps-expand-company-still-refuses-to-admit-they-even-have-caps.shtml), [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml), and [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150814/12144431948/comcast-admits-broadband-usage-caps-are-cash-grab-not-engineering-necessity.shtml) for details). 

If we're going to allow a company monopolistic control over a service territory, we can't also allow them carte blanche with their price structure. Basic economics says they'll abuse the privilege, and *that's exactly what they've done.*

Even better, *we used to regulate telecoms like utilities.* The overlapping infrastructure and high-profile bankruptcies of many of the overlapping telecom companies were some of the major causes of the regulatory actions and acquisitions that culminated in the foundation of the AT&T monopoly in the early-to-mid 1900s. AT&T, at the time, was regulated in a manner similar to a utility under the Natural Monopoly framework.^1

This is one of many examples of what we economists would call a market failure. Part of the problem is the way the regulatory agencies view telecom. It needs to be considered a necessity and regulated in the same manner as a public utility. Recent changes at the FCC have moved in the right direction, but there's a lot further to go. 

Do not be complacent. This will be an incredibly difficult fight and there are many other important and relevant viewpoints related to this that should be duly considered. 

I don't mean to suggest that this is the only viable option, just that it's been proven to work in the past with both telecoms and other public utilities. There are other valid solutions that should be duly considered; this is one of them.

^1 *The History of the Telephone* by Herbert Newton Casson. Pages 190-195 and 270-290

**TL;DR:** In a 21st century economy, telecom access is a necessity, just like electric, water, and gas, and it should either be regulated as such, or local governments should have the ability to establish their own broadband utilities. When you allow a company to have unfettered control over a service area without also regulating their business practices and cost structure, the customers (read: everyone) lose.  

*With the recent regulatory changes at the FCC, there is no better time to [submit our complaints, experiences, and comments to the FCC](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) regarding Comcast, Time Warner, CenturyLink and all the rest's actions. We are all being taken advantage of, and it is up to us to make sure the FCC comes out of this on our side.*

*Also do not underestimate the power of contacting your senators and representatives. They usually only hear the voices of the lobbyists. If we show them how much this issue matters to us, things will change.*

6348 :: Imgur is being used to create a botnet and DDOS 8Chan,"This isn't a DDOS. It's targeting 8chan users and leaving javascript code in their local storage that causes their browsers ping back to a command and control server each time they hit an 8chan page. Thus far the C&C server hasn't sent out any commands (or stopped issuing commands before this was discovered). Over the evening whoever authored this has been updating and changing their code. It only effects very specific imgur images/pages. Why is not yet known.

Things to take away:

* If you visit imgur and 8chan you may very well have a big issue. ~~Clear your localstorage (go to 8chan, open your browsers console, type localstorage and see what's there - then type localstorage = [] and hit enter) as well as all browser private information (cookies, passwords, offline storage, etc).~~ See edit #4 for a better way to ensure you're safe. Don't go to 8chan before clearing all local storage.

* **Imgur is compromised**. This is the big one and should be very worrisome to anyone on this site. There are three possibilities:

1.) There is an exploit in how imgur processes images that allows someone uploading an image to get code injected into the page when someone else loads the image from imgur

2.) Imgur has one or more servers that are compromised

3.) Imgur has a rogue employee injecting malicious code.

In all cases, this is really, really bad. It's very unlikely that a 0day exploit on a site as big as imgur is just being used to go after 8chan (unless it's case 3. and someone has a grudge). This allows whoever knows how to take advantage of the exploit to launch an XSS attack against anyone who visits a malicious page on imgur. And there's no way to tell before visiting the page. **Not all pages on imgur are compromised and right now it appears to be a very small number of images that had malicious payloads sitting on their page**.

How the attack appears to have worked:

1.) Malicious javascript got onto imgur's server somehow (via one of the three routes outlined above)

2.) This js created iframes and embedded a flash file hosted on 8chan. The iframe was off screen so a user would not notice. Since imgur typically uses flash for parts of its functionality flash asking to run on imgur wouldn't be seen as suspicious.

3.) This flash file injected more javascript into the page (while on the surface looking like an innocuous pikachu animation). This javascript was stored to the user's localstorage (which, since the iframe was pointing at 8chan, allowed the attacker to attach js to 8chan's localstorage). It's functionality is to issue a GET request to 8chan.pw (not an 8chan server AFAIK) and then decrypted the response. So far no one has been able to see a response from that web service, meaning it likely wasn't activated yet or has already been deactivated. The outcome is that every time a user visited an 8chan page, it would ""phone home"" to check for instructions and then execute more javascript code.

I would stress that everyone should disable flash and javascript on imgur for the time being. This attack may not be the only use of this exploit and a lot of very, very bad things could be done through XSS if more people are exploiting this. You should treat the entire site as potentially compromised until imgur addresses this and explains what happened.

Edit: The original thread has been deleted. What the hell. (In fairness this could have been done by the original poster or the mods ""for the lulz"" since it was in /r/4chan after all).

Is anyone else into technology?",219
"6317 :: Edward Snowden deserves a pardon at home, or else asylum in western E...","People need to understand that the Snowden leaks are easily separated into two broad categories: domestic surveillance and international surveillance.  

The NSA reform going through Congress is about one aspect of domestic surveillance (bulk metadata collection) that was the subject of the very first Snowden leak published.  But the vast majority of Snowden's leaks fall into the latter category: international surveillance.  This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  

Snowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), (not for treason), which applies to:

>**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which ***information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

Now why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.

[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): 

>“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.”

[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):

>Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....
>
>...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.
>
>They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.

[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):

>Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. “Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,” Greenwald said. “***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***”

[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):

>I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation

So even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to ""ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China"" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.

Here's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:

> Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.
> 
> Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing. At least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that.
> 
> **But now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into China and all this kind of thing. He is going a little bit too far. I don't think he had access to that program. But somebody talked to him about it, and so he said, from what I have read, anyway, he said that somebody, a reliable source, told him that the U.S. government is hacking into all these countries. But that's not a public service, and now he is going a little beyond public service.**

> If you dig deeper, you'll notice that all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding.

Reaffirming that the debate around copyright time spans not only was ignored but also ridiculed by even extending the span: 

> Perhaps the biggest overall defeat for users is the extension of the copyright term to life plus 70 years (QQ.G.6), despite a broad consensus that this makes no economic sense, and simply amounts to a transfer of wealth from users to large, rights-holding corporations.

And on ""good"" points:

> But we have struggled to come up with more than two positive points about the TPP, and even then the absence of these tragic mistakes is a pretty poor example of a positive point. If you look for provisions in the TPP that actually afford new benefits to users, rather than to large, rights-holding corporations, you will look in vain.

Thanks to the EFF folks for taking a closer and expertise-based look. There's a slight chance that the final ""final"" offers something different but seeing that they got a hold of the draft after the negotiations ended doesn't leave much hope.

That's just one chapter of the deal and also the one where the EFF at least tried to add constructive criticism while negotiating. It remains an interesting challenge as to how the other ingredients turn out but given the impression from above, the next few months may well be the ones of pro-consumer agencies to shine and the influence of corporate advisors to become clear.

So even though we were not paying for tickets, we were still spending about $200 - $300 for the day in the area. After rahm emanuel did away with the free days to people living outside illinois we stopped going. I would still drive there to pickup my brother from the airport when he flew in from seattle.

It was shady trick the city pulled. So I told my brother to start flying into indianapolis it was only a little longer drive, but no tolls, better roads, and no money grabby dirty underhanded tricks like the speed cams.

This is what needs to be mentioned whenever someone says the TPP will lead to an increase in GDP and in general benefits the economy. Yes it will likely lead to growth and yes there are benefits for consumers due to lower prices of products, but most of the benefits are for the wealthiest section of society and most of the negatives are for the weakest.

"6244 :: Advertisers admit it: ‘We messed up’ the Web ""The systems that allowe...","The rise of ad blockers reminds me of how 10 years ago a big driver of piracy (on top of people just wanting shit for free) was that DRM, companies being slow to adapt to new technology, and similar boneheaded business practices made it so that pirating shit was a much better experience than getting it legally. 

Remember when the only legal way to play some games/music on your PC involved installing copy protection shit that was practically a fucking virus on your computer? Remember when the only legal way to watch anime was to wait 6-12+ months after it aired for the domestic DVD release that was priced at ~$7-10/episode? It's similar with ads- when they're relatively light and unintrusive, they're great, but when they slow down load times, drain battery, or (worst of all) create sound it gets to the point where people consider blocking them.

Basically telling your employees that they either go with option A and do the same job for another company, with different policies, different hours, different pay, and different title (supervisors demoted, etc), or get fired (Option B) and in either way, they lose their PTO, Vacation, Sick Time, etc.... That's really disrespectful to your employee workforce, and ultimately shows what kind of company you are as a whole.

Personally, I see this as a start of HP's down-hill slide. Because as a consumer, I wouldn't purchase their products knowing they only care about the quantity and the money, not the quality.

This patent is for connecting multiple devices to a [palmtop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop_PC). USB and Firewire already existed when this patent was filed. Some dummy lawyer looked at the first picture in the patent and saw what looked like a USB hub plugged into a tablet and a keyboard, then thought, ""ca-ching!""

The patent filing actually points out that Firewire already accomplishes the same thing (daisy chain-able serial bus hub) but was more complex and costly than the patented design. I could be wrong (an EE would help out here) but USB and this patented device go about the same task in different ways. 

So the patent obviously wasn't intended to cover the concept of serial bus hubs, but rather a very **specific** design spec and protocol for a serial bus hub. 

IMO, this isn't something as vague as most of the software patent lawsuits we've seen in the last decade. At least those lawsuits have government stamped patent that (if valid) is being infringed upon.

The third test is how much effort you have to put into lobbying to maintain your position.

In the old music business it was the whole 1 good song on each CD/cassette/album.

In TV it was a variety of things such limited frequencies when antennas ruled, and then bundling good channels with lots of terrible channels so that pretty much anyone would have to subscribe to many bundles to get a handful of channels they wanted. 

Then in the world of cell phones they have the regulators pretty much locked down along with the fact that cellphone services are brutally cheap to deploy (despite their protestations). For instance in many parts of the world unlimited data plans on a 3G network cost a tiny fraction of what they do in North America. 

Long distance would be a perfect example. In Germany when the state telco lost its long distance monopoly the head guy said something like, ""Mark my words without our steady hand at the helm long distance will blow through a dollar or two a minute within 5 years."" I believe it cracked 5 cents per minute within about a year.

But my all time favourite is that one of the things many people who try netflix say is that they can't go back because they can no longer tolerate commercials. Yet there are cable channels that are speeding up shows so as to fit a few more commercials into them. What?!!!

That all said there are a pile of people who will not bother to switch from cable. I thought my sister was one but the local cable company is dropping the last of the analog. So for her to go digital will drive her bill from 44 to 71. She is dumping cable.

6137 :: 'Study Finds Quitting Facebook Makes You Happier and Less Stressed',"They questioned people after they disconnected from Facebook for a week.

A week? That seems hardly an accurate timeframe.

I quit Facebook earlier this year, and I would say for the first month I felt better. Didn't feel like I was randomly looking at posts that I didn't want to see. Didn't have to worry about the social ramifications of not 'friending' someone, and honestly, I didn't have to read the thoughts of people I knew because I honestly don't want to know what some people think.

But more importantly, my connections with people didn't seem fake, because some people I had many conversations with on Facebook seemed completely distant when I met them in-person. It was like we didn't know each other. 

**But then the new paradigm kicked in after a month or two...**

I realized that I had used Facebook to be social, to meet people, to connect with people, to bitch about life, etc. There really were benefits that I gave up to not have to deal with a lot of the negativity that I found from being on Facebook. 

I'm not going back to Facebook because the negatives outweight the positives, but leaving Facebook left me with the same feeling that I had when I finally realized I wasn't religious and left the church that had felt like home: disconnected. 

So I guess this study really only addresses short-term feelings. Based on my own anecdotal experiences. I'd be interested on the long-term affects, and how people adjust.

I can kind of understand of that.  Someone with financial issues is at a higher risk for taking money.  What really blows my mind are the number of people denied for marijuana usage.  The other really common one is ""foreign influences"" or ""foreign preference"".  Basically, if you think any other country is cool, you are out.  If you have a lot of contact with people in a foreign country (like family), you are out.  Marijuana, foreign influences, and finical issues make up pretty much all of the rejects in the list.

A few choice ones I found:

* *Applicant is a 36-year-old accountant with a history of illegal drug involvement consisting of using and buying marijuana during the years of 1996 2013. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02947.h1

*  Applicant falsified his 2013 security clearance application. He used marijuana in 2011 while holding a security clearance. He has not mitigated the security concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02696.h1

*  Applicant has a close and continuing relationship with his family in India. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-04993.h1

*  Applicant has used marijuana for about 34 years and intends to use it in the future. He was also less than candid about his usage in 1991 and 2002 on Questionnaires, and in a 1992 interview. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02491.h1

*  Applicant is 53 years old and is employed as an Aerospace Engineer for a defense contractor. His foreign preference for Germany could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-05457.h1

*  Applicant is a native of Israel and a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has surrendered his Israeli passport to his facility security officer. His spouse and children are native-born U.S. citizens. His mother and brother are citizens and residents of Israel. His daughter recently moved to Israel, became an Israeli citizen, and joined the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). His brother is a citizen and resident of Israel, retired from the IDF after 20 years of service. Foreign preference concerns are mitigated, but foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. CASE NO: 14-02496.h1

*  Applicant used marijuana sporadically between July 1998 and August 2013. He did not present information sufficient to mitigate the security concerns about his drug use. His request for a security clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02674.h1

**And a couple of really amazing ones that makes you wonder WTF ones**

*  Applicant is 40 years old. While serving as a police officer, both on-duty in uniform and off-duty, he engaged in sexual intercourse on four occasions with prostitutes. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline D, sexual behavior. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-03638.h1

*  Applicant owes approximately $105,000 in delinquent debt, including almost $75,000 in child support. He is on probation after serving three years in prison for attempting to commit illegal sexual contact, enticing a minor by computer, and violating a condition of release in July 2008. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02059.h1

*  In 2010, Applicant was charged with various violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and convicted by a Special Court-Martial of two violations of Article 121, UCMJ. He was sentenced to 85 days confinement, reduction from E-7 to E-5, ordered to forfeit $1,500, and fined $3,800. When asked on his e-QIP about any police record, he lied. Applicant also had substantial delinquent debts, totaling approximately $31,546 that had been placed for collection or charged off. Yet, when asked on the same e-QIP about his financial record, Applicant again lied. He subsequently admitted falsifying his responses. He offered no explanation for his falsifications. There are some indications that Applicant�s financial problems are not under control and he may simply file for bankruptcy to avoid paying his delinquent debts. Applicant�s actions under the circumstances cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied. CASE NO: 14-01506.h1

*  Applicant is 36 years old. He was arrested numerous times and was convicted of domestic violence, driving under the influence, obstructing government operations and running a stop sign. He had numerous criminal offenses nolle prossed. He was acquitted of a drug trafficking charge and had another drug charge overturned on appeal. It has been six years since his last arrest. Applicant provided considerable rehabilitation evidence. He has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline H, drug involvement. **Clearance is granted**.

6026 :: Uninstalling Android's Facebook app made a bigger improvement than I ...,"No wonder. All of Facebook's apps, including Messenger and Instagram, insist on ignoring Android's built-in push messaging service (GCM) and rolling their own.

This means a separate, persistent socket connection for each of them. All of those connections have to periodically send ping messages to check if they still work and reconnect if they have been disconnected for any reason.

Leaving the house, switching from Wi-Fi to mobile internet or vice versa? Each of those connections has to be reestablished, every single time.

Of course, all those connections are maintained by services that require ~40 MB of memory all the time. When there is not enough memory available, Android will kill and restart those services... Which wastes a ton of battery and, again, requires a reconnection for each of them.

Incredulously, the only exception is WhatsApp, which properly uses GCM (provided it is available and working correctly). If GCM good enough for the most widely used messaging app in the world, why does Facebook insist on ruining everybody's battery life with every other app they are offering?

I am regularly checking each and every app on my phone for that kind of behavior by sniffing all network traffic over my Wi-Fi connection. Facebook's apps are the only three that do it like this. All other apps, including all messengers like Signal, Hangouts, Threema, Slack and Line, which arguably depend most on working push messages, manage to get by just fine using GCM.

5967 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse,"Here is a good article from the IDA regarding the problems of LED lighting for streets.

http://darksky.org/citizens-push-back-on-led-lighting/

Its not that they are LED, its that they are the wrong color temperature.

Edit:Some of you are asking about the importance of color temperature.

The short answer is that cooler color temperatures are more disruptive of our circadian rhythms.  It's not just humans that are affected either.  

There was a great documentary called [the city dark](http://www.pbs.org/pov/citydark/) that was released a few years back.  The film goes into greater detail about the effects of light pollution.

The only way that light pollution will be taken care of is if it becomes part of the design agenda. We could optimize our wavelengths for better restfulness, but then driving visibility would decrease at night.

We could provide more aimed reflectors, but then we couldn't spot that deer off the side of the road as well...

It is all trade-offs.",2585
5967 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse,"For once my profession is relevant, I have done large scale sales with CREE lighting (LED's). 

LED lighting usually delivers more lumens. The problem is not with the LED lighting itself, its with how the light throws the lumens. This is called directional lighting. We can now aim where we are throwing light by the configuration of the fixture and amount of LED's in it.  You can literally throw out a 90 Degree angle of light at a corner of a street. The problem being, the more technical, the higher the cost. Over time this will go down. We need to make sure we are aiming light only towards the ground (Obvoiusly some will still rebound no matter what), and cut out what's ""Spilling"" up into the sky.

Edit: Here's an example where light won't spill up:

http://www.cree.com/Lighting/Products/Outdoor/Streetlights/LEDway-Streetlights

The problem is not he LEDs themselves, it's non-educated and non listening government officials. Blue light is not recommended to be used at night (that's why apps like f.lux exist). Blue light at night destroys our perception of day/night cycle. And what do the city governments do when you give them official recommendations of what kind LEDs (what kind of arrangement, what kind of power, spectral distribution they should have, etc.,) they must use? They say that ""it's bad light"", buy the most cheapest china LEDs which say that have the most lumens (which usually means lots of blue light) and say ""that's how street lighting should look like"".

Dunno if this is just filtration (which is a waste of energy) or if the diodes are being tuned, but I think Milan and other cities that transitioned to LED's so early jumped the gun.

Now there are going to be hordes of technology-illiterate constituents who are going to blame the technology for a problem caused by the city's lack of foresight and research. Of course bluer, brighter lighting is bad, but warmer and softer LED's were coming around at that time. Could've waited.",27

* Wireless networking research depends on the ability of researchers to investigate and modify their devices.

* Americans need the ability to fix security holes in their devices when the manufacturer chooses to not do so.

* Users have in the past fixed serious bugs in their wifi drivers, which would be banned under the NPRM.

* Billions of dollars of commerce, such as secure wifi vendors, retail hotspot vendors, depends on the ability of users and companies to install the software of their choosing.

* Mesh networking which helps first responders in emergencies, also helps provide anonymity, creates a backup/alternative communications network, will become more difficult than it needs to be with these new rules.

* Users should be able to manipulate and control all aspects of their devices.

* The ability to run fully open source software on your devices will be severely hampered and possibly impossible with these new rules.  

* These new rules will make it extremely difficult if not illegal, to make an open source baseband for cellphones to prevent rogue towers like Stingrays. It will also harm any attempts to build open source cell towers and systems.

Everything works on a spectrum.  WiFi is religated to a particular spectrum.  Now, firmware is, now, typically what regulates what spectrum your wifi operates on.

The entire presentation was on just outcomes for first time, non-violent offenders and proper allocation of DoJ's limited resources. I couldn't help but notice the extreme disparity between the initiative and her actions on the Aaron Swartz case. 

During the Q&A, one of the professors asked about the Aaron Swartz case. I can't recall the question exactly, but I think she asked if putting Aarzon Swartz into a position where he would have to plead guilty or risk being sentenced to enormous jail time was just punishment for a first time, non-violent offender. Carmen Ortiz said the entire thing was misconstrued, that she did not intend for Swartz to serve a long prison sentence, and that his suicide was unfortunate. There was more to it, but it was so long ago I can no longer remember. 

These kinds of speeches are typically recorded by the law school and available to students for later viewing and I couldn't wait to post the video on Reddit as soon as it was available. I learned the next day that after the end of the event Ortiz asked the faculty organizing the event to delete the video. I'm not sure if that is a common request, but it was granted.

It's been three years of inaction on the passing of the Aaron’s Law Act to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act under which he was charged. The bill was proposed to reform the Act that was passed in 1986 when the country was spooked after the movie War Games saw a schoolkid hacker inadvertently almost initiate global thermonuclear war. It wasn’t possible, but the Act was drawn up swiftly and passed, and the country felt safe again. Today, when techology has moved exponentially beyond that of 1986, that Act is still one of the prime tools used to prosecute any online acts of tech dissonance.

5893 :: Time Warner Cable is About to be Sued for Violating Net Neutrality Ru...,"I'm reposting this from another thread... but this is a shady company. This is very much a false claim and CNS will lose this.

I do network engineering, I work with some large datacenter networks. We push hundreds of gigabits of traffic. It's extremely rare to get ""free peering"" unless you're also a network carrier and both parties are mutually benefited by the exchange.

This sounds like a company who wants to get the ISPs to pay for their connectivity. While this may seem like a net neutrality issue, it's really not - net neutrality would have been an issue if TWC degraded speeds to/from their network by using ACLs/throttling to selectively slow down this company.

From my limited knowledge on this specific situation, I don't see how they have an argument. I wish we could get Verizon and Comcast to bring us peering simply because their users connect to us, but it simply does not work that way. I'm responsible for having enough bandwidth to support the requested traffic in the first place.

Take a look at their peering: http://bgp.he.net/AS29697#_peers

They have no direct connections to any big name ISPs, except for maybe Hurricane Electric. Why am I not seeing any Level3, Zayo, NTT, nLayer, Verizon, Cogent, Quest, AT&T, etc? They say they're peering with Google, Microsoft, and others, but all I'm seeing (publicly) is a bunch of second and third tier datacenter and hosting companies. Their traffic destined to /me/ takes a Level3 line the datacenter they rent space from pays for.

Them getting Settlement free peering from Microsoft and Google hardly makes sense. Their business is pushing video streams to ""eyeball networks"" (residential ISPs usually), so why peer with Google and Microsoft and expect to get much? There aren't that many Google Fiber customers yet... This sounds like they're all members of an Internet Exchange in a Datacenter or city somewhere. That is not direct peering. This is also why you don't see it in the public BGP route tables, since it's really just a quick shortcut to get from one network to the other, not actually an Internet route.

But then the real question is what about TWC? How are they currently involved with CNS? Here's the kicker. They're not. To get to TWC, CNS is hitting their datacenter provider network, then Level3, then TWC.
If there was any legitimate peering dispute, it would have to be between Level3 and TWC. CNS can't just ask for a router port from TWC for free. That's not how this works.

CNS pays for bandwidth from NYInternet, who connects to Level3, who then peers with TWC.

CNS must have a lot of traffic destined to TWC (on their scale, not TWC's scale), so they're trying to save money by making TWC give them a port.

Even if the links between Level3 and TWC were getting saturated or degraded intentionally in some manner, this argument should be between Level3 and TWC.

CNS and/or NYInternet simply need to buy more bandwidth from Level3 or start buying from TWC directly.


TL;DR - ...That's not how any of this works. These guys are doing something fishy. Reddit is blindly support this.

___

EDIT just wanted to post my theory as to what CNS is really doing:

There is a few different things that could be going on, but I'm thinking what CNS is having happen is they send a lot of content to TWC's customers. Since they feel TWC is consuming this content, they want TWC to give them a network port somewhere to directly connect to TWC.

CNS could either get more capacity from NYInternet, get a another connection to directly Level3 or buy another connection from a different provider, or buy a connection directly from TWC.

I do not believe there is any upstream peering points between Level3/TWC that is so congested at CNS is feeling the crunch much. Level3 and TWC push so much traffic that CNS has never been heard of.

CNS really just wants a free connection directly to TWC on TWC's dime. If they want settlement free peering, they need to have TWC pushing equally as much traffic back into CNS, but I know that's not the case. I bet the only real traffic/requests from TWC to CNS are the original content requests.

This is proven by CNS saying TWC's customers are requesting the content for CNS, and that TWC is responsible for that. If this is a problem, CNS should just block TWC customers from their service... Let's see how long they last before regretting that. TWC will not miss them, so there is no way this could be settlement free peering.

It also makes it easy for shady ""free flashlight"" apps to steal tons of information from people who don't pay attention to the permissions.

5855 :: Spotify: SORRY. We are in the middle of rolling out new terms and con...,"Note to every IT/Tech company in the world:

Keep your goddamn marketing department at bay. Treat them like a dog and whack them on the nose with a newspaper every now and again.  If you don't, they will do you in in the end.  It happens time and fucking time again. Whether it's through sleazy T&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;Cs, surreptitious data gathering, or leaks/breaches because marketing morons value all that juicy demographic data over security, service and functionality. 

I'm not sure why people have so much disdain for lawyers - marketers make the lawyers necessary through their bullshit shenanigans. 

Edit- ITT: Marketing hacks who think I know nothing about business. Sorry, I've owned a small biz that employs about three dozen folks that hasn't seen a down year since we started 11 years ago. That's because I say that product and service to the customer come first, fucking period. You pull some customer-unfriendly bullshit and you're out.  I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't met marketing folks who have told me about all the money I could make by bending ethics here and there. Nope.  

Embracing a bad market plan is suicide. It's the quickest way to your demise - and the guys who propose it won't care; they'll be out before the consequences set in.  Any change in marketing requires measured analysis and guarded change. You should never surprise your customers, and your customers should never surprise you. This is what I mean by keeping marketing ""at bay"".  But companies don't get that today. Comcast, EA, Lenovo.. Doesn't matter.   

Everyone replying is acting like this Spotify situation is some kind of exception. Really? As we sit here on Reddit, a site that owes its very existence to a company deciding to fuck over their base for some esoteric market realignment?  And tell me what is killing Lenovo right now.  Tell me what keeps Android fragmented. It ain't the tech. Please, spare me. 

A good read on the topic is ""From Good to Great to Gone"", by Alan Wurtzel - son of the founder and the former CEO of Circuit City. An excellent story of how to run a good company into the ground by letting your marketers run unchained and live in their own ""brand is king"" echo chamber. ",685

"5842 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - ""While it'...","To clarify,  he is posting content from behind a pay wall,  not his own annotations. His argument is that it's an abuse of copyright to put that particular content behind a pay wall.  The state's argument is that it costs money to have annotated versions available, and that instead of using tax dollars they put it behind a pay wall so that only the people that want to use it pay for it (like toll roads).  To me, that seems to be a specious argument assuming the annotations already exist and simply need to be uploaded,  but I am not a lawyer or a legislator. ",2892
"5842 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - ""While it'...","Georgia lawyer here.  

Just to clarify, the state of Georgia has a deal with Lexis Nexis to host ""free public access"" to the Georgia Code.  You can see it [here - click on the ""Georgia Code"" button on the menu on the left side of the page](http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx).

I'm not familiar with this dispute, but it sounds like what this guy is trying to publish is the O.C.G.A. which is an abbreviation for the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated.  This is the text of the law with annotations compiled for the most part by the publisher, not by the state. Each statute is followed by pages and pages of annotations containing the legislative history of each statute (essentially, the individual Public Law citations every time the statute was amended over the years) and then citation of cases - law suits interpreting various aspects of the statute, including a brief summary of each case.

I don't know how much Lexis Nexis works with Georgia's legislative counsel in compiling these annotations - I suspect not at all. This is Lexis Nexis' intellectual property -- the very reason people pay thousands of dollars for their books and on-line resources.

EDIT - after reading the lawsuit a little more carefully, it looks like Georgia has an arrangement with Lexis Nexis where Lexis Nexis creates the OCGA and has exclusive publishing rights, but the state owns the copyright.  That's why the state is the Plaintiff.  I'm guessing there's some sort of contractual obligation for the state to enforce the copyright.",568
"5842 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - ""While it'...","The linked article, and the articles engadget links to, are pretty terrible. A key point is that the laws of Georgia ARE posted freely, can be downloaded and posted by anyone, etc. There can be no copyright in the laws of Georgia.

BUT–what is in question here is the annotated version. The annotated version is not a secret set of laws, but rather, it's commentary, it's citations to caselaw, it's the equivalent of a student putting notes in the margin to make things easier to reference.

Reading Georgia's complaint, I'm still uncertain if Georgia paid Lexis-Nexis to create this content as a work for hire, or if the deal is that Lexis-Nexis creates the annotated version and then recoups their costs and makes profit off the subscription fees. (GA said ""[t]he copyrighted annotations include analysis and guidance that are added to the O.C.G.A. by a third party publisher of the O.C.G.A. as a work for hire"" but also said that without the paywall, they'd have to do away with the annotations or use tax dollars to pay for the development.)

Either way, several key takeaways. First, again, the law of Georgia is being posted freely. It's the annotated version that is behind a paywall. Second, it is not at all clear that taxpayer money was used to develop the annotated version, even if the State of Georgia claims the copyright. Third, there is no general right to an annotated version of the law. Four, you don't NEED an annotated version of the law. It can be nice to have, but the things it links to (case law, opinions of the Georgia Attorney General, and legislative history), can all be found, for free, elsewhere. You have to do more work, but the annotations are Cliff Notes to things that are freely available. 

Lastly, some people seem to think that the annotations are things that are used ""to establish case law"", are ""referred to by...[a] section of government"", or are ""being used to guide the decisions of the judges in actual legal cases"". This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the value of the annotated code is. With possible rare exceptions for legislative intent, the annotated code isn't what decisions are being based on nor will the language of the annotated code be in a decision. Generally, the annotations are merely an index to the primary sources that will be used, cited, and otherwise referred to. Lawyers, judges, etc. aren't going to say that the annotated code points to cases X, Y, and Z, lawyers and judges are going to point to cases X, Y, and Z. If there was no annotated code, they would STILL point to cases X, Y, and Z, and they'd probably still use Lexis (or Westlaw, or Fastcase, or Loislaw, or another private paywalled legal database company) to find the information.

EDIT: I'll concede that this arrangement is definitely strange, in that even after reading the complaint and the articles, I'm not sure why the State of Georgia has the copyright to the annotated version and not Lexis. But it's NOT strange for there to paywalled, private legal resources that are commonly used in a jurisdiction. There are several large legal database companies that take publicly available information, add their own annotations, headnotes, etc., and put them in expensive, proprietary databases. It is legal to republish Supreme Court decisions. It is not legal to republish Westlaw's or Lexis-Nexis's version of Supreme Court decisions with all the headnotes, annotations, KeyCites, and other tools that they added on to it.",64

5838 :: Obama Administration Unveils $4B Plan to Jump-Start Self-Driving Cars,"Okay, my civil libertarian side is showing... I think it's incredibly important that self driving cars report no non-anonymized data back home, for multiple reasons.

First of all, there's no need to know the exact location of specific cars.

1) Any self driving car will need to be able to operate safely even if they hit a network dead zone. This means network access can not be a prerequisite for safe operation.

2) Traffic avoidance can be done by measuring overall traffic in the area with anonymized/averaged data. 

3) A fully self driving car won't require the driver to be licensed. There is no reason to need to know the occupants of the vehicle. If they can only input addresses, there's no potential for negligence or impairment.

If the data for the location for individual cars is available, anywhere, it will be used to spy on us. Since that data cannot be a prerequisite for safe operation, it should not be an intrinsic part of navigation to begin with.

Also, I don't think I've heard anyone talk about this yet, but with thousands of 3d scanners constantly roaming every street, it could have unbelievable effects on our ideas about surveillance and privacy. If someone had access to all that data, even for ""safety"" purposes, they could have an up to the minute 3d scan of almost every roadside property in the city at a moment's notice. Not only that but they could extrapolate the owners and travels of any arbitrary car by simply watching it from other cars sensors from the beginning to the end of the trip.

Any safe self driving car must be able to operate with no network anyway, we really should make sure nobody ever successfully demands that data, ever, for any reason.",233

5751 :: Windows 10 will no longer let you Google search from Cortana,"I think it's pretty clear that there are large advantages for AI search assistants like Siri, Google Now, and Cortana to pipe the queries through their own search engines. The different parts of the engine can be integrated together to produce results that can go above simply feeding back the results of a web search.

With the recent Build conference heavily centered around AI, I'd expect Cortana (which is actually a very capable product when compared to competitors) to get stepped up a few notches and really start to do more powerful stuff with the query results. A lot of this is going to be dependent on information processed on cloud computing (like Wolfram Alpha's results) and will depend on queries being sent to Microsoft's own datacenters.

I guess I'm not as against this as most seem to be. Services like Cortana and Siri will increasingly diverge from old school web search results. That said, I don't see why typing ""Google X"" into Cortana shouldn't do a Google query. It's a feature meany people will use, but I can definitely see why MS doesn't want external engines set as default as the product evolves. And yes, of course there is a ""walled garden"" appeal as well for MS, but I honestly do think there's more to it than that.",367

[I am](http://areben.com) the creator of **[All Prior Art](http://allpriorart.com/about/)** ( [proof](http://allpriorart.com/reddit) ) I saw a bunch of traffic to the site from here so figured I'd be available to answer questions. ([Please read the ""about"" page before asking a question](http://allpriorart.com/about/))

Note: Will return later to answer any additional posts

FAQ (I noticed some repeat comments):

*Aren't you taking away people's ability to be innovative and profit from it?*

-The title of this reddit post may have skewed the initial intent, which was:
""The concept is to democratize ideas, provide an impetus for change in the patent system, and to preempt patent trolls."" The ideas generated should be highly derivative and not especially innovative or creative.

*There are no dates, therefore not usable as prior art*

-Each unit generated is timestamped with [UNIX epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (which is a date to the second) and archived on [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/AllPriorArt/) with a timestamp

*There is not enough information in the text to be prior art*

-There was some debate among lawyers I spoke with if the text was enough for a person ""skilled in the art"" to reproduce the ones that make sense. I think many if not most are (courts would have to decide), but just in case I made a sister site with more verbose but less human readable output at [All The Claims](http://alltheclaims.com). Further, I think if this website is ever used in a legal case, a lawyer can make a good argument that if a computer can generate it, it then fails the ""obviousness"" test for a patent. 

*This is stupid / it won't hold up / the patent office won't use it / etc..*

-While it will be great if this turns out to be a viable tool to fight patent trolls, as long as it is sparking discussion and thinking, it is performing its purpose. If it does turn out to not hold up in court, maybe a similar idea will. This is running off an old server in my studio, imagine if there was a patent troll with the resources of Amazon or Google putting effort towards this idea - coupling much more hardware along with better algorithms and things like deep learning actually publishing algorithmically generated patents. I think this signals a need for a new way of thinking about IP in certain contexts.

*Do you have a good example?*

Likewise, thanks to Apple and Microsoft for outright rejecting Exchange 2003 servers. The product is LONG depreciated, has known exploits, and companies I work with refuse to upgrade ""as long as it works.""

For those who don't know: The internet isn't one thing. It's a collection of things. It's an ecosystem. And as the ecosystem evolves, so must the nodes that you use to talk to that ecosystem. Supporting archaic systems is both [impractical financially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), and ill-advised because old, depreciated systems always have unfixed security holes that will compromise the integrity of the entire ecosystem. If someone has an insecure mail server, and you send an e-mail to them, that's it. Your e-mail, your private thoughts and medical records, your company secrets, are now public. It can even be intercepted in the middle (as it hops from one node on the internet to the next) without ever touching the insecure server.",38

5662 :: USF study shows police body cameras reduce use of force. During the y...,"Small town Cop here. 

I just want to start off saying that I do support body cams, and having one would not make me do my job any differently. But there are things that need to be considered. So for anyone wondering ""well if this study is true, why aren't all police wearing cameras"". Let me explain:

First off the big one: cost. These systems are incredibly expensive. We just had training last month on body cams and concerns. If I get around to it I can even upload the PowerPoint we went through. Cost was a big one. For my department its just... Not possible. Our city council has to approve it. I mean shit they even took away funding for our dashcams in our cars. I mean it took until we had 30 minute response times from being shorthanded before they approved hiring an additional officer. They just don't see cameras as a use for us. Now we haven't had issues because of lack of cameras. Our officers do a great job. So it hasnt been an issue.... Yet. We would only need about... 5-10 cameras for our department. 10 if we each had our own. Or 5 if we did some kind of shared system. Our council still won't fund it. Now imagine a department the size of LA or NYPD funding it....

A second concern tied with cost is storage of the footage. Our county attorney determined that we would need to save the footage for 7 years. So anything we record saved for 7 years. Costs of storing that would be huge. 

Which brings me to the next point. What do we record? Do we record every call? From the time we get on to the time we get off? 12 hours of footage that might not even have anything on it? Do you wanna see my bathroom and coffee breaks? Or me sitting at the office on my phone? Only calls we go to? Only criminal calls? Medicals? HIPPA would have a hay day with medicals since we ask for practically their entire medical history. And the footage would have to be available to the public just like dash cams. What about juvenile calls? We can't release info on juveniles. Even in our reports we don't give DOB and use initials. That won't be the case in video. Do we pay someone to edit that out? Hire a new staff member just for video? What else could they edit out though?
 
There would need to be a huge department policy overhaul with the addition of cameras. Which isn't bad, but even after hypothetical approval from city council to purchase them, it would be at least another year before we get a policy in place and purchase, and train officers in the use of them.

Also if we did record everything another thing to note. People will hear officers talking amongst each other. We have a dark sense of humor. We might talk about a gruesome car accident like some people talk about Monday night football. People might take offense for that and start criticizing us based on that. 

Like I said I support the use of cameras. But there are tons of considerations that need to be made before everyone can be outfitted.",175

Orlando, Tampa, and the Pasco Sheriff's Office have been working in tandem on getting this program up and running. However, at Pasco, every road deputy employed wears body cameras and incurs significant negative repercussion if they're not worn or not recording. Including termination if you refused. That's 500+ deputies wearing cameras, and I'm sure that number is low, I just don't know the actual number of sworn members off the top of my head. 

Overall, it's a love hate relationship. It costs my agency, which is considered federally as an extra large agency, millions each year. They're extremely tedious (recording, uploading, and tagging videos). They're inelegantly cumbersome with wires and bulky devices. They're constantly breaking and in need of fixing. There's constant software errors. Several male deputies have had to answer to their sergeants as to why they filmed their penises pissing (accidentally leaving it live). There's no perfect way to film, it's either on your head, shoulder, or neck. 

But... They keep the honest deputies safe and the dishonest in line. They reinforce positive public behavior and assist in record ways in incriminating criminal behavior. They captivate everyone into being ""right"" regardless of who you were before hand. They save careers. They save money. THEY SAVE LIVES.

Edit: Okay -- After reading a bunch of comments, I'd like to incorporate some suggestions into the fix.  
As /u/DrTBag said:

>If a company issues 1 mullion requests and none of them are false it will still be free and issued immediately. If another company issues 100 and they're all false their future claims would be delayed while investigated and only applied if they are genuine. 

How about this? If you're a copyright troll or some other sleazebag, and a bunch of your DMCA takedown-requests to YouTube are successfully appealed, or found to be legitimate fair use, then your only recourse for asking YouTube to take down a video is via US Mail, or other fairly expensive form of communication.  
You don't get to email them anymore.  
If you're sending hundreds and hundreds of takedown requests, and you had to spend USD $0.49 for a stamp for each request, you might think twice.  

""Due to the number of takedown requests you have filed which have been successfully appealed in the past, in order to better document your actions, we regretfully inform you that future takedown requests filed under §512(b)-(d) be done so in writing. Please print out your takedown request and send it via US Mail (certified mail is preferred) to  

    YouTube
    Silicon Valley, USA 
    Earth

Thank you for using YouTube!""

I read a little of the DMCA language, and it looks like there's an ambiguous ""or"" in the language:  

>The notification is in writing, signed physically or electronically by a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright allegedly infringed.  

I am not a lawyer. But there seems to be some wiggle room there. If the notification has to be ""in writing,"" it seems a provider could demand an actual piece of paper with writing on it.  

Seriously, the 49 cent stamp could fix a lot of this.

5595 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...,"I do a lot of iOS device repairs. I've logged over 11,000 repairs now on iPhones and iPads mostly over the last three years. I'm super careful and rarely make mistakes, but they do happen. The home button cable for the TouchID is extremely fragile on the iPad Mini 3. Slightly lifting it wrong can tear that cable and you're stuck buying the customer a new iPad instead of replacing the cable or button. This just happened to me. It's infuriating to lose all profit for a day because of a problem that could be handled much better.

Apple says this is due to security and I agree, there shouldn't be repairs that should be able to be done on TouchID. However, if you replace the button, iOS should default to making you use your passcode. You lose Apple Pay &amp; TouchID. Your phone is still secure. Anyone saying Apple can't do this is blind if they think one of the biggest tech giants can't make that software change instead of what seems retribution for not getting serviced through them, which coincidentally costs way more $$$.",106

5595 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...,"I'm sure it's infuriating, but when I read to the end of the article I found Apple's explanation for the error:

> A spokeswoman for Apple told Money (get ready for a jargon overload): 

> “We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. 

> When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. 

> This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. 

> **Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted,** thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. [emphasis mine]

> When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.”

> She adds: “When an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. 

> With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an ‘error 53’ being displayed … If a customer encounters an unrecoverable error 53, we recommend contacting Apple support.”

I'm not excusing the lack of a fix, but the issue seems valid.

Edit to say, thanks for all the replies, and many good points were made. My final thought on this is that Apple seems to have forgotten we all vote with our wallets, and they aren't even the dominant vendor. ",1515
5595 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...,"If I can unlock my phone using my passcode instead of Touch ID, then 'if' the sensor becomes compromised the phone needs a graceful procedure for turning off the touch sensor and relying only on passcode.

I've been impressed with what they have been able to accomplish from the R&D side but I can tell you first hand that actually producing them is going to be an enormous challenge (not that it wasn't already known). Ramping up is simply not a matter of what you can handle at the final assembly facility but also at supplier factories. Not to mention that even speeding up the assembly line by only 10 seconds can take months of preparation, not only from the human assembly standpoint but also from the body welding and paint robot side.  Ramping up is typically done in steps across a long period of time to be able to monitor end quality accurately. I would be blown away if they could produce 100,000 plus units within the next year and half without having major quality control issues. Training man power takes time, planning manufacturing machinery with anticipation of future production additions to avoid bottlenecks takes time, waiting for suppliers to ramp up takes time. Tesla will slowly but surely take a solid piece of the market, but they are nowhere close to threatening well established manufacturers who already have facilities and money in place. I really do wish them all the best, they are challenging how we think about transportation and as we all know competition breeds excellence.

Unintuitive applications and features along with obscure UX is increasingly bad.  As someone with decades of experience and a computer science degree, I have a fighting chance to work out how to make the device do what I want.  Trying to explain it to my parents is a lost cause.

To me, it seems like Apple has too many UX people, all tasked with making improvements.  The net effect is 'change for the sake of change'.   My parents knew how to search on their early iPhones.  Now, it's ""slide down on the screen and it will show a search input"".  WTF?  It's not intuitive, and there are dozens of examples of more of this.

The merging of iOS concepts into Mac apps is also a disaster.   ""Photos"" is garbage.  Change for the sake of change.  It doesn't work well as a desktop app.

I understand that not everyone will have a niche use like this, but to me it makes a world of difference to simply flick my wrist to check the number that governs the steps I take to survive every day. 

That being said, I can definitely tell that I am using a first generation device. The processor is slow. The apps (especially 3rd party) have periods where they can't share data with the phone. As a medical device, I think the Apple Watch could be a major game changer as the hardware becomes more sophisticated and the software more mature. 

With rumors of the Apple Watch 2 being announced in June, it is tempting to return the watch and buy the next one, which I expect to iron out the annoyances I have with the first model. But whether or not I do return this model, I will most certainly be picking up the Apple Watch 2. It's just too nice to see my blood glucose level without digging my phone out of my pocket. I also love being able to easily access my todo list and triage tasks from my wrist. Time travel is super cool. I think the watch is quite beautiful.

Likewise, taking steps to protect your anonymity does NOT constitute probable cause for a search.  This should be very much illegal.

I feel for law enforcement, their job has become very difficult lately, but that does not justify the gross violation of the rights of the innocent.  This is a clear violation of the US Constitution 4th amendment rights against unreasonable searches.  Refusing to be searched is not probable cause for a search.

Edit: As has been pointed out, I misinterpreted the article.  Having now read the actual law, the issue is more about jurisdiction.  This law would give law enforcement the legal power to hack into a computer without getting a warrant from a judge in the jurisdiction where your computer is if they don't know where your computer is.  There are some international problems with this (it's giving law enforcement a legal basis for hacking into computer in, say France, without asking for the French government's permission).  

Another problem is that, even if you are in the USA, if you use anonymous services, law enforcement could, potentially, use any judge to grant a warrant, not just the one in charge of your district (ie, they can ask for a warrant from a judge in a district where they are more likely to say yes).  

So, this law would make it *easier* for law enforcement to get a warrant if you're using anonymizing services, but the use of those services alone still would not constitute probable cause.  They just now have to prove probable cause with the minimum/most-lax standard, rather than the standard of where you live.",2252

So let's either buy everyone the car of their choosing (which is prohibitively expensive) or let them drive *nothing* instead.""

This is an example of ""letting the perfect be the enemy of the good"". In other words, in arguing against Internet.org, it *sounds* like you're being righteous, but in reality you're  just being self-righteous; all this argument does is harm the people it's intended to help, in the name of helping them.",314

"5424 :: Woman who got 153 robocalls awarded nearly $230,000","Cross-post from the other thread on this topic:

Attorney here:

The law this woman sued under is the ""Telephone Consumer Protection Act"" (or TCPA for short). I do this kind of work for a living.

Simply put, the TCPA prohibits prerecorded or autodialed calls or texts to cellular telephones without consent (the type of consent needed depends on the type of call). Damages are $500-$1500 per call.

There are other prohibitions as well (related to the Do Not Call List, landlines, and junk faxes). See this [cheatsheet](http://i.imgur.com/8S2Z5rv.png) I very quickly put together. I also wrote a lengthy YSK (needs some updating) a few months back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2ywtop/ysk_your_rights_and_remedies_for_junk_faxes_and/). Not legal advice, etc etc.

It's important to keep in mind, however, that just because the calls are illegal does not mean there's always someone to be held accountable. Many of the calls come in from spoofed caller IDs, overseas, scammers, etc. My short hand in determining if a company is likely worth suing? The calling company 2 of the following: a website, a live phone number, or a Google search of the calling number links back to the caller. Not guaranteed worth it even if it has two of those; not guaranteed to be bad if it doesn't.

That explains also why calls continue even after the ""Do Not Call"" list. It's not that the list doesn't work, it's just that the companies who violate it often don't care that they're violating it because they're shady and hard to find.

I have a few cases under this law currently pending. One relates to those ""free cruise"" text messages. Another relates to 600 text messages received after my client wrote a letter asking the company to stop. Another is a company that  used ""confirmation"" text messages as a sneaky way to advertise by sticking an ad at the bottom of each text (likely millions of texts).

Some other items from a business perspective, for those interested: for an individual case, I usually prefer 20+ calls, but it depends on the facts. Otherwise, I usually bring these cases as a class action. My take is 1/3 (so in the event of a $229,500 award, I would receive $76,500). If we don't win, I don't get paid. My take in class cases would be a lower percentage (judges rarely approve anything close to 1/3 in a class settlement; 15-20% is more accurate).",202

My father-in-law rents his farmland to a local company that has invested in some very cool equipment.  He talked the company into letting myself and my young son ride along in the combine.  I think I was ten times more excited than my son once I realized I was driving in an autonomously driven vehicle! 

The operator had his hands nearby the steering wheel so he could take control if there was something they needed to dodge.

After explaining how well it worked and watching it for a bit I glanced over at the tractor that had pulled up along side us.  The combine was unloading the corn it was picking into the trailer the tractor was pulling while it was picking more corn.  It didn't take me long to realize the driver of the tractor was not in control of the tractor.  He had his feet up, the driver chair turned backwards, talking on his cell phone.  I asked the combine operator what was going on and he said that the combine was controlling the tractor as well.

It's also clearly a clumsy solution to target the ""right to erasure"" that everyone really cares about.

I note that because ""private_personal_info"" represents such a large majority of removal requests, it means people made over 77,000 inappropriate requests for removal of information at the 37% rejection rate.

5385 :: CISA vote is tomorrow. Contact your Senator and voice your opinion now,"Here's a short history of Internet advocacy for those of us who joined sometime after 1992 or so.

Netscape Communications Corp created SSL, for HTTPS, for secure shopping.  Phil Zimmerman made the ""PGP"" encryption tool, uh, a long time ago.  Up until that point, people at home never really used encryption, and the US had export laws that made it illegal to provide strong encryption to people in other countries, because as far as the government was concerned, encryption was very much a military thing that militarizes used.  They had no idea how or why citizens would use it.  Protecting your information on line was a brand new concept.  Before encryption was popular, there were people breaking types of security, such as Mitnick social engineering Motorola out of cellphone firmware because he was curious, and rooting Unix systems and collecting passwords, and stuff like that.  At first, mostly only big companies were on the 'net, after it opened up to stuff other than just academic institutions.  So, hackers were people who stole corporate secrets, as far as the government was concerned.

Steve Jackson Games, makers of CarWars, GURPS, Illuminati, and a bunch of other fantastic table top games and RPGs, created a Cyberpunk GURPs expansion.  The FBI got wind of it and raided their offices, confiscating basically everything, but not filing charges.  Basically just taking their stuff to punish them.  That was kind of a mistake because Steve Jackson Games had friends.  Lawyers got together and sued, and won, and got a promise that the FBI (or was it the CIA?) would never do anything like that again.

Steve Jackson Games immediately went on to make Hacker, loosely based on Illuminati, where players build a network with cards drawn each turn, and then try to take over the 'net, helping or interfering with each other as they go.

The government was still trying to throw everyone in jail who seemed like they might at all be a threat.  People who made network security tools (SATAN was one of the first ones) were prosecuted.  The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was used to throw anyone in jail who did anything ""unauthorized"" computer a computer.  People who worked in IT who told their bosses that their passwords were weak were thrown in jail for ""hacking"" (because obviously they were doing something bad and unauthorized if they knew their bosses passwords were weak).

The bleak political scene is part of what prompted the creation of the EFF by the people who defended Steve Jackson Games.  So, SJG was their first case, really.  They've sued and organized and advised on legal matters dealing with technology ever since.  Everyone here who has an income of their own should be a membership.  I think memberships start at something like $40/year for students.  Flying teams of lawyers around to (quite often successfully) sue the government takes money.

Not long after that, Netscape and PGP scared the government.  The US government was in the habit of keeping its global operations secret while trying to crack other nation's communications.  Laws were introduced that would require all encryption to use ""the Clipper chip"", a proposed design that works sort of TSA luggage locks, where the government knew how to crack it.

This wouldn't have worked, because academic and amateur cryptanalysis are too good.  It would have been widely installed, difficult to replace, and completely broken.  You'd have to have a physical piece of hardware.  Software encryption would have been illegal under that this law, including jailing people who wrote it.  EFF's position was that cryptography is just math, and you can't jail people for doing math.  This was narrowly defeated, thanks to lots of Internet advocacy.  It was kind of wild-west back then.  The attitude of ""this is our space, you assholes have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, fuck off and leave us alone"" was much stronger than it is now and was shared by entrepreneurs, academics, hackers, and hactivists alike.  Everyone was on the 'net for a reason; everyone was part of something; no one considered themselves ""just a customer"".  Just like Reddit has a community, places with strong sense of community have always existed on the 'net, but in the early days, there was also a sense of an Internet community, that defended the Internet.

If that had happened, it seems extremely unlikely that the e-commerce revolution would have happened.  At no point would people's data ever been safe.  We needed ssh and HTTPS to do that.  We also needed legal computer security research, and the EFF has non-stop defended researchers who frightened the government.  Again and again, some kid would come out with some security tool, and the government would try to lock them up.  Amazingly this still continues, even though computer security is now a respected industry, and it's well establish that good guys as well as bad guys work in these technologies.

TV news was running idiot scare stories that were extremely loosely based in reality in that they took jokes and ran with them as if they were epidemics, sort of like when everyone was felching and that was the new sex act that everyone couldn't get enough of.  News is a bit more savvy now days as pathetic as they are.

There were legal efforts rooted in copyright, too, that were successfully defended.  There was a ""blue ribbon campaign"" (when the web was a lot jankier, everyone had these on their sites... hmm, I should bring that back):  https://www.eff.org/pages/blue-ribbon-campaign

Laws were pushed and nearly passed that would make it illegal to link to something that links to something that has copyrighted material on it, making people responsible for the actions of other people, and making everyone responsible for checking the legal status of everything.

There was another law floated and defeated that would make ISPs liable for the actions of their users, so if you posted copyrighted material online, your ISP could get sued.  The obvious result of that would be that no site would be able to accept the legal exposure of hosting content for people unless there was money and legal contract involved between those two parties (ie, you're paying for hosting, and even then, to cover their liability, they'd have to charge a lot more).  This was back in the days where free hosting like anglefire.com were just appearing, and it was difficult and expensive to run your own server (had to stick a machine in colocation for $200/month or so, and Linux wasn't really stable or mature yet), and ISPs were just starting to offer web space for their customers.  So basically it was designed to turn the Web into cable TV, where people at home observed commercially produced content, but didn't produce content of their own, because the cost was too high and companies had to deal with liability.  That was defeated.  Sites like imgur that let people casually post things came much later.

tl;dr Stupid laws are never ending; the EFF is fucking awesome so get your membership today; the Internet is only still around right now because we defeated those; we need those who weren't there when this all started to stick with us in protecting this cesspool of awesomeness.  Thank you. ",157

This is all within a mile or two of city limits. Some of these places are surrounded by million dollar homes, and yet... nothing.  
  
Realtors continue to act suprised when I tell them it's a deal-breaker if there's no broadband. Builders continue to put $400k+ homes up with no internet.

The machine design was funded by the British Government under the BBC (yes, the TV station). The Basic was designed by university students and put Microsoft's Basic (by far the most common) to shame.

They were made by Acorn where is where the RISC chips that dominate mobile phones have their roots. All in all a very worthwhile affair as Governments have the fiscal base to do these things (though sadly do not do enough) with different goals then what drives private companies.

Failure to comply with standards is kept secret, so it becomes standard practice not to comply. When 'fake it until you make it' becomes SOP, all pretense of actually investing resources to get things resolved properly are thrown out the window.

Then a few years later, when systems begin to crumble under the weight of business need and obsolete infrastructure, the asshole who cut corners has moved on (or up) and the ripple effect of that original incompetence becomes business halting tidal waves of long overdue maintenance.

Of course, I favor IT because I work there. But look at the country in numerous other respects. The war on drugs, California's droughts, bridges literally falling apart... These are not new problems. These are indicative of decades of incompetence, compounded with poor planning, that only begin to breach public awareness once the mess has become too widespread to conceal any longer.

I did some googling and found out I could put black electric tape over the sensors, and use a secret command on the numpad of the machine to reset the counter to continue printing.

The question posed at the hearing was:

> As a general matter, is it correct that anytime there are copies of an encryption key — and they exist in multiple places — that also creates more opportunities for malicious actors or foreign hackers to get access to the keys?

and the response was:

> Again, it depends on the circumstances, but if you want to paint it very broadly like that for a yes and no, then i would probably say yes.

So to be clear, the director of the NSA is acknowledging that with each additional copy of an encryption key in existence, the probability that one of those is compromised goes up. That's not a revalation, that's just common sense. I would have been considerably more concerned if his answer had been that he did not believe that was the case. The debate here isn't over whether the risk is increased, the debate is over whether the benefits outweigh the risk, and since this question was only answered in a very broad, very general sense, it does not speak to that. If someone can point to one or more specific cases where government possession of encryption keys lead directly to a breach (and that has probably happened on many occasions, I'm not saying it hasn't) then that is significant, but that's not what the question or the answer were about and it's disingenuous of this headline to imply otherwise.",1158

Finally they said it would just plain slow down recruitment and be a logistical nightmare with their existing drivers so the city strengthened the language about the mobile fingerprinting, phased in the requirement, and put in language requiring the city to evaluate the program and make changes if it was affecting onboarding.

"5222 :: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism: ""The game is no longer about ...","Can confirm. Work for an online ad agency with several of the country’s largest retailers as clients. Advertising revenue have shifted significantly in the last 5 years. Running banner ads on your site is no longer the cash cow it used to be, now it’s tracking your customers shopping habits (albeit anonymously) and selling the information for other brands to leverage. You’d be amazed how granular the data can get.

Edit: I wanted to shed a little more insight into a topic I can actually speak to, even if it’s realtively high level…

First, this practice is nothing new. It’s just what common advertising tactics have evolved into as we mover further and further into the information age. Advertisers have been buying demographic data as a means to target consumers since the advent of junk mail. Even today, custom mailing lists are generated and sold based on a number of variables (household income,  credit rating, family size, geographic location, etc). This data is collected in a number of ways, sometimes simply by combing through public records. 

Now we move to the dawn of the UPC. Walmart is in large part the behemoth it is today because it embraced the potential of data tracking through scanning UPCs at the register. Every product scanned was tracked, every purchase analyzed. From a high enough level, behavioral patterns will inevitably emerge. All those seemingly unrelated items sitting in the middle of aisles, in random locations throughout the store are anything but. Everything is strategically placed based on observed customer behavior. At this point, barring any personal association to a purchase via a credit card, this information is largely anonymous. And in reality, you personally don’t matter in this equation. You’re just a statistic in a sea of consumer data.

Enter the rewards program. Now brick and mortar stores, before e-commerce became king, could tie you *personally* to your shopping behavior. That data could then be analyzed internally and sold to third parties. You, in turn, receive personalized and/or exclusive savings for volunteering said data. Check out the small print, especially the privacy policy, next time someone asks you to sign up for their rewards program. Now we’re beginning to see consumer behavior become a viable revenue stream for retailers.

The internet grows and stores are born online, while existing brick and mortars see more and more of their sales shift to online shopping. Tracking users and their paths to purchase in the digital sphere now introduces a cornucopia of data to analyze that was previously unavailable. As e-commerce got its start most of this data was used to simply optimize the retailers’ online presence - learn more about their customer base for their own self-interest.

Online advertising continues to grow and some retailers look to cash in on their site traffic by serving banner ads. Makes sense, this is how everyone else is making money with advertising online. And more revenue streams is always a good thing. But for retailers this is a double edged sword - banners drive away traffic from your site, and may lead to purchases through other avenues. To keep ad revenue higher than potential sales losses, you need more ads. And you need to setup restrictions to keep conflicts of interest at bay, along with teams to monitor and enforce these rules. You can see how this snowballs into a veritable cluster. But there’s money to be made, with an entire industry of people telling you it’s a good idea. To this day there are opposing camps internal to every retailer who opens up their stores to external advertising. 

Online retailers are now everywhere, and competition is getting fierce. Stores now have to start looking inward again and focus on their bottom line - driving their own sales. Plus, internet users are getting savvy, now there’s all these annoying ad blockers whittling away ad impressions. Banner ads are no longer the golden goose they used to be. But wait, what if there was away to make money on ad sales *outside* of the store? 

If Google has proven one thing, it’s the power of the algorithm. With tremendous amounts of data and the right formulas, patterns of behavior inevitably surface. Enough data and enough patterns, and soon you’re odds of predicting future events gets exponentially better. We’ve seen it in several facets of life, from predicting the weather, to the likelihood of a baby boomer purchasing a luxury sedan. So now more and more retailers online are developing proprietary applications to gather and analyze as much information about their customers shopping behaviors as they can, and sell the service to advertisers to serve targeted ads outside their store. To retailers this is a huge win. Ad revenue without the hassle of dealing with banner ads vying for your customers attention while they’re shopping your site. Within the industry this is know as **Audience Extension**. Retailers are literally treating their customers (or audience) as a commodity. The level of granularity and the sheer amount of data you can provide is what gives you a competitive edge. For this reason, I’lll refrain from getting into any specifics as to what is being obtained. I primarily work on the creative side of advertising, not the technical, so I don’t have all of those specifics anyway. A majority of the data I see is all relational and demographic based. A theoretical example: fashion conscious millennials are 25% more likely to buy a hybrid.

Now, as I mentioned before, this is largely anonymous. You are just a set of correlated demographic data that gets lumped into a huge analytical engine, connecting the dots to an unimaginable number of patterns and relationships. Can this be used to manipulate you as an individual? Absolutely. Advertising at its core is just manipulation. Trying to coerce some kind of emotional connection between you and some brand or product. And remember, all of these relationships and patterns are found by observing, you, the consumer. They’re not contrived from thin air. Like it or not, human beings are very predicatable, habitual creatures.

TL;DR - The article is a little darker than need be IMO. What they are labeling as *consumer surveillance* is a logical evolution in existing advertising practices as we move further and further into the information age. The end result being advertising that is more relevant to the user and a better ROI for the advertiser. If this troubles you, then you as a consumer need to remain vigilant. Every time you browse an online store, create a personalized account, sign up for a rewards program, or let your insurance company track your driving to save a few bucks, you are volunteering your personal behaviors and preferences to be thrown into the data pool to some degree. And no one is collecting data just for the hell of it. Data = money.

Thus they will do anything to merely survive and sustain themselves, and if that includes violating the Constitution or breaking other laws, then so be it.

There was a Noah Wyle movie Pirates of Silicon Valley that had a pretty scathing interpretation of Jobs' personality.  Woz came out and said the film is about 90 percent accurate; that it really was like that.  The one scene that really bothered me about Jobs was he didn't bother to give stock options to an original designer/engineer/whomever who was there from the start, even when Woz confronted him about it being unfair.  Woz did the right thing and gifted some of his own options to make sure the guy was taken care of.  Jobs dismissed it as ""whatever, fine"" and walked away.  ",220

5177 :: Man sues Apple after retail employee deletes years worth of photos,">Apple argues that White ""has not demonstrated how he suffered any loss.""

Wrong thing to argue.  Apple should be arguing that he knew the risks when he signed the work order at the Apple store (which traditionally says that you agree to the wipe).  By arguing that he didn't suffer any loss, they're just asking for a jury to side with the plaintiff.  He obviously suffered a loss, it's just happens not to be Apple's fault.

5177 :: Man sues Apple after retail employee deletes years worth of photos,"Years ago I set an employee up with a new machine, transferring her data from the old machine to a new one. 

Set her old machine aside for a week. Asked her if she had everything she needed. She said yes, so I formatted the drive and sent it out for recycling. 

Next day she says she can't find her wedding plans. So apparently she didn't have everything and her old data was now permanently gone. 

She complained to her boss and my boss, they both said the same thing to her: Do you have what you need to do your job? Because you shouldn't be making wedding plans on company time. 

She accepted it and moved on and even apologized to me for getting angry at me. 

But her friend at work wouldn't let it go and would harass me about it daily. That eventually cost her her job. 

Over the years I've been amazed at the number of people whose personal lives are comingled with their business data. I get that 'everyone does it', but that doesn't make it a good idea. ",92

1) According to the Evening Standard, the man won the case for a total of £2,000, less than the £5,000 he was seeking. Source: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-pensioner-sues-apple-and-wins-after-tech-giant-wiped-treasured-honeymoon-photos-from-his-a3126511.html

2) It doesn't sound like this necessarily happened as part of a Genius Bar appointment. If it had, Apple's defends would've been pretty iron-clad - as many of you have pointed out, he is warned before coming into the store, several times during the appointment, and signs a work authorisation explicitly stating that Apple is not responsible for loss of data. However, for a basic troubleshooting case, the man may have simply walked into the store and asked for help. There are many sales representatives who are happy and have the knowledge to help people sort through basic issues, such as the spammy texts he was receiving. It's extremely unlikely that they would go to the point of erasing the phone on the shop floor, but it's possible, and it's possible (though unlikely) that the sales rep (who is not a trained tech) didn't ask him if he has a backup before erasing the phone. The originally incident happened this time last year, meaning the store would've been flooded with temporary seasonal workers who don't necessarily know what they're doing, because they don't receive the same amount of training that normal employees do.

3) Regardless, that's a dick defense for Apple to take. They have to argue this, because otherwise it opens a HUGE Pandora's box of problems for customers who have accidentally had their products wiped for one reason or another. But to say, ""He has yet to demonstrate he lost something of value"" is a dick way to put it.",71

I wish there was a meaningful  number, like Nielsen TV ratings:  how many tickets were sold, what percentage of the population as a whole that represents, and what percentage of the moviegoing public that represented at the time; in other words, what ""share"" the movie got.

Is movie viewership actually going up or down?  What about movie viewership relative to population?

**Officer Matthew Isham Claims the Kilton Library Supports Terrorism. He's Wrong.**

In America, it can be easy to feel that freedom of speech *just is*, like a physical law of nature. Unquestionable, omnipresent, incontrovertible.

But history tells us this is not the case. In reality, the struggle for the freedom to voice an opinion requires constant vigilance. Vigilance against people like Matthew Isham of the Lebanon Police Department.

A few months ago, the Library Freedom Project got together with the Kilton Library to set up a Tor node. A Tor node is a computer program that facilitates anonymous communication online by accepting and forwarding data.

In response, the Boston Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Lebanon Police Department, leaned on the library to shut it down. They claimed the library was supporting terrorism and criminals.

Can Tor be used by criminals? Absolutely. So can a knife. But when a criminal uses a knife, we don't go after the knife manufacturers. We go after the criminals. The Lebanon Police Department chose to go after the knife manufacturers.

The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to a free society. When Thomas Paine published Common Sense in 1776, he did so anonymously. Would the pamphlet that helped spark the revolution ever have been written if he had to put his name on it?

Anonymous communication is no less vital today. It is used in dozens of countries with oppressive governments. It was used by the reporters who broke the news that our own government has been spying on our calls and emails for years while lying to us about it.

When the Kilton Library set up a Tor node, they may not have realized they were part of an endless struggle between those who believe in freedom and those who would control us.

When they vote on Tuesday whether to continue running Tor, I hope they choose freedom. And I hope more libraries join them.",92

>Washington, April 25, 2016 – In connection with the announcement by the Department of
Justice concerning the Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright House Networks transaction, FCC
Chairman Tom Wheeler issued the following statement:

>“Based on imposed conditions that will ensure a competitive video marketplace and increase
broadband deployment, an order recommending that the Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright
House Networks transaction be approved has circulated to the Commissioners. As proposed, the
order outlines a number of conditions in place for seven years that will directly benefit consumers
by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband
deployment. If the conditions are approved by my colleagues, an additional two million customer
locations will have access to a high-speed connection. At least one million of those connections
will be in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, bringing
innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband
provider overbuilding another.

>“In conjunction with the Department of Justice, specific FCC conditions will focus on removing
unfair barriers to video competition. First, New Charter will not be permitted to charge usage-
based prices or impose data caps. Second, New Charter will be prohibited from charging
interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet
traffic to broadband customers. Additionally, the Department of Justice’s settlement with Charter
both outlaws video programming terms that could harm OVDs and protects OVDs from
retaliation– an outcome fully supported by the order I have circulated today. All three seven-year
conditions will help consumers by benefitting OVD competition. The cumulative impact of these
conditions will be to provide additional protection for new forms of video programming services
offered over the Internet. Thus, we continue our close working relationship with the Department
of Justice on this review.

>“Importantly, we will require an independent monitor to help ensure compliance with these and
other proposed conditions. These strong measures will protect consumers, expand high-speed
broadband availability, and increase competition.”

Even with the rapid growth, solar still accounts for less than 1 percent of total U.S. power production, behind coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear and hydroelectric, according to the government’s Energy Information Administration. Because output suffers on cloudy or hazy days, grid operators have to keep conventional plants on standby.

So the headline makes it sound like solar is as important as shale gas.  It isn't.  A high growth rate on a small number isn't meaningful.

Don't get me wrong, it is headed in the right direction.  But that doesn't mean we should all be googly-eyed at solar.   It has gone from a fraction of a percent to a rounding up of 1%.

5043 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix,"I get the fact that everyone likes being able to use VPN's to jump between different Netflix regions however banning VPN's or other work around solutions isn't Netflix's fault... if you want to assign blame assign it to the content creator.

Basic primer for how it works:

1.   I create an amazing TV show called ""Butterflies vs Rabbits""
2.   I license it to Bell Canada as an exclusive for their online services in Canada... they in turn give me a bucket load of money.
3.   I license it to Netflix as an exclusive for their online service in America... they in turn give me a bucket load of money.

At this point everyone is pretty happy, however there are a bunch of viewers in Canada who don't care to use Bell Canada's service and prefer Netflix so they VPN to America and watch it there rather than signing up and giving Bell any money.

1.   Netflix is getting money from US customers they purchased the rights to show the ""Butterflies vs Rabbits"" to.
2.   Netflix is getting money from Canadian customers they didn't purchase rights to show to.
3.   Bell is  getting less money than it should because it knows viewers are watching a show it purchased and exclusive right to.

So Bell calls me up and is like WTF man, you told me I could have all the Canadians - however Netflix is letting the Canadians come in no problem!    I then turn to Netflix and say listen, you allowing Canadians in is going to hurt my relationship with Bell and next year they aren't going to give me my bucket load of money for my new show ""Turtles wear TopHats"" because your stealing their customers... you need to put in restrictions so that you don't allow viewers from countries you don't have rights to.

This happens several times with several content creators until a few of them start saying listen if you won't restrict you can't have our content anymore... eventually Netflix caves.",375

5000 :: The Online Privacy Lie Is Unraveling - A new report asserts that a la...,"I've started to wean myself off of Facebook recently-- I was chatting with a friend, IN REAL LIFE, about a product, with Facebook on and the next few days I've been getting ads about the product. 

I did not search for the product. I did not search for the product category. I did not discuss the product category with anyone over Facebook in messages. I did not put it in any email. 

So I got curious and looked: Apparently they've been doing this since February of last year, when it unlocked a ""feature"" that listens to your background for recognizable sounds like TV shows and music, to ""help you identify songs in your status updates"". I absolutely do not remember turning on such a feature.

On facebook's website:

>the app converts any sound into an audio fingerprint on your phone. This fingerprint is sent to our servers to try and match it against our database of audio and TV fingerprints. By design, we do not store fingerprints from your device for any amount of time. 

But they can record what got matched after the fingerprint gets converted, then delete the fingerprint.

I use Google Now, Siri, and recently an Xbox Kinect. I've agreed in the TOS to let them listen to me *all the time*. So in a lot of ways, this is a ""well I kind of deserve it"" situation because if tomorrow they announce that ""yeah we're listening and converting your background sounds into a profile"", I can only have myself to blame.

But I feel safe because I have no idea what else it has been tracking me on. I know about [location history](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0) where it shows where you've been, and that Google photos can ""recognize"" things in my pictures, but I honestly don't know what that info converts to about me as a person.

The really scary thing is **I actually don't know what they know about me**. I only ""don't mind"" my privacy because I don't know what they actually see or track. I wish there was a button I could press with these companies that's just like ""show me what you know about me, specifically as a profile""-- if you're going to data mine me, at least tell me what I've been mined of.

I've ended up using Bing Translate for translating web pages, and while it does not translate colloquially as perfectly, it translates just fine for readability.

* [No-Script](https://noscript.net/)

if you really want to, you can globally allow scripts, so you won't be bothered to add your own whitelist, and still have some protections against malicious scripts, but not data-marketing web page scripts

* [Self-Destructing Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/)

keep this enabled for all sites that you believe will track you across other websites, like Amazon or Google.

Edit 2: Android also has a fully supported version of Firefox. I don't know how many of these add-ons are supported for Android Firefox, but it's worth a try to at least use some of them. Plus, you can sync your Firefox on Android with your desktop or laptop.

Google's version of Android and the Android that comes with your phone has terrible privacy. You aren't given enough control over what data apps and the operating system can send to various companies like Google or marketers. I recommend trying out either CyanogenMod, Oxygen (I think?), or Replicant OS. Replicant is fully freedom respecting and even fixes some serious security issues that still remain with the latest Android. It's a few versions old, so if that's not your thing, you can still try out the other two.

I also recommend getting rid of Google's Play store system, and use a different store system that gives you more control over your Android OS and applications.",59
5000 :: The Online Privacy Lie Is Unraveling - A new report asserts that a la...,"They do have the power though - they can stop letting themselves be marketed to.

I registered a washer with LG so that it would be possible for them to look it up if I needed service (and I did need service). I bought it from Home Depot online, and today in the mail I received a warranty extension offer. That either came from Home Depot selling my info to the warranty company, or it came from LG selling my info to the warranty company, I'm not sure which.

Either way, they wasted their time and money, because I won't be buying it. Why? Because.... I decided I won't be buying it. If more people did that, instead of being suckered by marketers, then there would be no profit in data collection and it would simply stop happening.

There are only four basic things you need to know:

1. Marketing people are professional liars and bullshit artists
2. Don't believe a god damn thing someone who is trying to get you to part with your money is saying
3. Don't believe packages or labels on anything, they are full of shit
4. The fundamental nature of companies is to make you think you're getting a deal when you're really not

That's it. One you understand those four things, advertising stops working on you, and you're free to pursue information gathering more objectively. 

Here's a classic:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRISkyV_B8&feature=youtu.be&t=1m17s

The Shamwow guy trying to tell you ""you're going to spend $20/month on paper towels anyway"". Yes, statistically speaking, you probably are. But will you spend $20/month on paper towels just to absorb liquids? No. You clean up dirt, and food, and paint, and other grimy shit that you wouldn't want to ruin your Shamwow with. At first, it sounds like a deal - that it's going to save you money, but it's actually ***COMPLETE BULLSHIT***

Plus, physics. Shit gets worn out. You think that shamwow is going to be as good as new after a few trips in the washer/drier? Nope. Nowhere did that commercial disclose the actual durability of the product. That's what marketing is - all flash, no facts, and no substance. Stop buying into it and it stops being profitable.",45
5000 :: The Online Privacy Lie Is Unraveling - A new report asserts that a la...,"Privacy as we know it is dead.   You have absolutely no idea how much both the government and corporations have about you.  

If you think you can avoid being datamined....you really can't.  You will slip up.   Most people who think they've got their browser locked down with every adblocker and script blocker under the sun don't.  Or at least they don't have them configured properly.  Or they ""whitelist"" certain sites because ""those"" sites are OK.  Or there are any number of holes left in their so-called locked down browsers that are leaking data like a sieve.  

Newsflash:  They're not.  They're all doing the same shit.  And saying that your site(s) of choice are OK to whitelist because ""they need the ad revenue"" or ""they wouldn't do XYZ"" or ""I don't mind blah blah blah"" is the same line of reasoning that people use to say ""We should vote out every member of congress....*except my representatives*.  Because ""my"" reps are OK.  It's the rest of congress that's fucked up"".  And then we wonder why nothing ever changes.  The same shit happens here.  It's not ""my"" personal favorite sites.  It's the rest of the internet.

And even if you do have your browser locked down like Fort Knox....it's not a whole lot of good if you're tethered to your smartphone that's running Facebook and god knows what other apps that are tapping into your mic and just listening to your conversations, with or without your knowledge or consent.  

Corporations damn well know that 99% of consumers can and will be easily data mined -- including the ""privacy conscious"", most of which don't have the first clue how to properly lock down their data.  They know that 90% of customers simply don't give a shit (the whole ""I'm not important enough/don't care about privacy/don't mind the ads/whatever"" crowd), and 8.99 of the other 9% of people who are privacy conscious and think they've got their data locked down...don't.  The number of people who actually give a shit about privacy *and* know how to lock down their data is so small that it wouldn't even qualify as a rounding error.  

We're being conditioned...by the governments AND by corporations...to think of privacy as a last-generation relic that only those with ""something to hide"" cling to.  There is already a not-insignificant number of people out there who think that the only people who value their privacy are those with skeletons in their closet.  Within 10-15 years, privacy-conscious people will be looked at in the same way that we look at 9/11 truthers, anti-vaccine morons, and other conspiracy theorists.

"4977 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers","From the article:

http://www.wired.com/2015/09/hey-fcc-dont-lock-wi-fi-routers/

>So, is the FCC mandating that manufacturers lock down the whole router—including its operating system? Not really. The guidance is more what you’d call (badly worded) guidelines than actual rules. More importantly, guidances aren’t written by the same people who write the actual regulations. In fact, the FCC explicitly told TechDirt’s Karl Bode that it’s fine with mods and open source software “as long as they do not add the functionality to modify the underlying operating characteristics of the RF parameters.” So, modding the operating system? Okay. Modding the RF parameters? Not cool.

From the referenced techdirt write-up:

https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20150831/07164532118/no-fcc-is-not-intentionally-trying-to-kill-third-party-wi-fi-router-firmware.shtml

>Curiously nobody seems to have asked the FCC what they think about all of this. So I asked, and the FCC offered me this admittedly clunky statement (note the underlined bit):
>
>>""(FCC rules) require that the devices must ensure that under all circumstances they comply with the rules. The majority of the devices have software that is used to control the functionality of the hardware for parameters which can be modified and in turn have an impact on the compliance of devices. Our rules do permit radios to be approved as Software Defined Radios (SDRs) where the compliance is ensured based on having secure software which cannot be modified. **The (FCC's) position is that versions of this open source software can be used as long as they do not add the functionality to modify the underlying operating characteristics of the RF parameters.** It depends on the manufacturer to provide us the information at the time of application on how such controls are implemented. We are looking for manufacturers of routers to take more responsibility to ensure that the devices cannot be easily modified.""",426
"4977 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers","I find the whole not being able to flash thing a huge deal, but I wouldn't mind if the radio itself was a separate chip with a super-locked, read-only firmware to prevent illegal power levels and bands. You get black helicopter'd for that shit anyway.",161
"4977 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers","Locking out changing the wifi OS does nothing to stop the underlying hardware from operating in ranges outside of the legal ranges for the region the device was sold in. Any controls would have to be done on the radio chip itself at the time of manufacture or by the third party device manufacture to lock the hardware for the region where it is being sold. 

If the chipset can still be bought and manufactured on any board I want to design there is nothing locking me out of operating that radio device in unlicensed ranges. Sure, not a solution for your average user but there is nothing stopping me from doing that by making an unrelated company lock down their software.

An easier solution would just be to have someone in another country ship a device to me that operates in the ranges I want. Only now I would not be able to configure the OS to operate in the new region where the device is located.

The device manufacturers could also just not put an OS onboard. Add an SD slot instead of flash and provide an image that does not let you set illegal ranges. Consumers could just pop in any image on an SD card that they want. Without locking the radio chipset anything else is pointless.

The only real way to fix the problem would be to have a globally acceptable operating frequency range. Good luck fixing that.",8
"4977 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers","The FCC does not, and has never, wanted to ""lock down your wifi router"".  They want to lock down the chip *inside* the wifi router to prevent you from exceeding FCC broadcast power limits or broadcasting on an unregulated frequency.

It's already illegal to do it, they just want to make it impossible to do it with a common consumer level product, as well.

There was already a big warning message when I installed Gargoyle on my router that said ""This can unlock certain channels which are illegal in Canada and Germany, and using them can result in severe penalty or fine"".  So if you're against locking down the chip to prevent that from happening, surely you're against the law that already exists as well?",15

"4977 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers",The whole thing is misguided. The problem is that the router manufacturers are cutting too many corners and bind the wifi chips with the user end software functionality. If they wouldn't bind those two things together the FCC wouldn't have to slap their wrists and force them to lock it down and in doing so lock you out.,3

Karsten Nohl and his team were legally granted access to SS7 by several international cellphone carriers. In exchange, the carriers wanted Nohl to test the network's vulnerability to attack. That's because criminals have proven they can get into SS7.

Ok, so this attack was so easy because the German hacker already had access to the ss7 network, which is of course a lot less hacking than we were supposed to think from the introduction.

By the way, all in all good proof of concept, and they were smart to throw in the congressman card

The world is a very scary place. The amount of companies, *big* household name companies, that have poor security practices is quite honestly breathtaking. I've crossed dozens of businesses off my list of places I would trust my information or health to.

Maybe it's due to Hollywood, but I'd say *most* people believe that cyber-crime is done by elite hacking groups hitting high value targets. That's rarely, if ever, the case. It's more like people using authentic Victorian doors and locks, and then neglecting to upgrade them to modern locks as time progresses. Funny thing, one tumbler locks are crazy easy to open. Today's data breaches are typically the result of entirely lazy hackers sending out waves to robots to try every lock with their skeleton key. If it works, they're in! If it doesn't, they just move on to the next door and try again.

It's my job to know how to lock down a network. And boy howdy, you can screw things down extremely tight these days. But when profit margins are more important than infrastructure, you're not hiring the best security experts. Almost every day I speak to people with bachelors degrees and numerous certifications, and they didn't even bother to read the product manual. They're running their security suite with the default configuration, because no one is checking their work. And until they have a problem, no one will. Very few companies do security audits ""just for fun"".

IT Directors, and the bosses they have to please, tend to operate on a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mentality. The problem is, software breaks all the time. That's why we have patches, and updates, and new releases. But if you're the kind of lazy asshole who doesn't even read the product documentation, what are the chances you're keeping up to date on release notes or vulnerability bulletins? Oh, you may *think* it 'ain't broke', but when a few thousand customer records are compromised because of an SQL exploit, you're going to wish you were better at your job or you may not have one for much longer.

IMO, the reason that financial systems and payment processing models have evolved so pathetically slow over the past few decades while we now have internet terminals in our pockets, is that those industries **explicitly** value profit over innovation. The reason why you can't wave your phone at a checkout stand, have funds deducted from your account, and a receipt emailed to you in under a minute is because there's zero incentive for companies to improve the customer experience to that degree. If the market will continue to bear paper receipts, transactions by dial up, and X hours for transfers to complete, then they will *never* upgrade those systems. Not unless they're forced to.

Like most problems with crumbling and outdated infrastructure, it tends not to be a priority because most people don't know about it. And that's an enormous failing of our media and information channels. Case in point, this news story would have been just as accurate five years ago. Or, as the article points out *twenty five years ago*.

My point is that we are off loading our own personal memory requirements onto digital mediums.  The smart phone (primarily) is becoming an extension of our our own mind.  I think people are going to have to actually start implanting electronics in their brain before society clues into this.

So, is it a 7.00pm event or 7.30pm event (as the invitation says)? Also, the post says there were about 3,000 people at the event.

If that's the case, and the invite says to be present at the venue by 7:30pm sharp, that means that the event is not expected to start for another 30 minutes at least until all the people are accommodated. Hell, I've waited longer for some events with much less attendees.

Also, bashing the presentation definitely is a personal attack:

Well, there are no excuses as to why the event was late at all, and I think Elon (and Tesla in general) should've both apologized and catered some food as the people were clearly waiting, but all of this just sounds as an exaggeration by a disgruntled customer.

4898 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.,"Encryption backdoors are missing the point.

If you by law require all encryption to have backdoors, a few things happen.

First, private encryption research leaves the US. It leaves any country which requires backdoors. This isn't even speculation, we saw this happen in the 90s where encryption merely suffered from export restrictions.

Second, Everyone who cares about encryption switches to these outlaw encryption tools. This means that actual terrorists/criminals using encryption continue to be safe. This means that people who merely want to protect their privacy become criminals.

Third, As is usually pointed out first, encryption everywhere in the country becomes only as secure as a single master key. When(not if) that key leaks, all encryption is broken. The only people safe from this are the criminals.

Encryption backdoors are bad for security, bad for the tech industry, bad for consumers, and unhelpful for law enforcement. The only thing they're good for is bulk surveillance.",544

Now imagine this was happening everywhere all the time: you're walking down the street and you hear English and also this obscure language. People's mundane conversations overlaid with unintelligible secrets. 

For a while, no one would know what the fuck anyone is saying, until some genius figures out that they're all just speaking Esperanto and if they just learn it, they'll have access to everyone's bank accounts.

I uninstall all the preinstalled Norton/Symantec stuff (usually recommend a free edition antivirus combined with Windows Defender/MSE), remove the PowerDVD/Roxio crap the client doesn't use, the MS Office Trial Version crap (Apache Openoffice/LibreOffice is fine), then I go through the Windows startup queue and remove all the Spotify/Quicktime/Itunes/Bank ID/Dropbox/Steam/Outlook/Weather News autostart crap, check Windows Update for optional/hidden updates, restart, and lastly finish off with a system registry/trash cleaning.

Last software thing is to do a Windows Experience Index update, and whaddayaknow? In many cases, after sorting out both hardware and software issues, half or most of the scores have increased by 1 or 2 points.

Usually I help people go through their bookmarks and delete duplicates/dead links, sort email folders, pictures, transferring photos from cameras to computer, install wireless printer, fix their WiFi so they get the strongest possible signal from it, help with creating additional email adresses, basically anything computer-related, even reinstalling Windows and downloading all the necessary drivers for the laptop in question (many people throw away their software discs).
It usually takes three to five hours, an entire evening. They pay not just for my time, though, but for 20 years experience with finicky comps.

My 60 dollars per started hour is taxfree (and doesn't include travel time), which is a hell of a lot better than most computer outlets in Stockholm, whose technicians start off at 120-180$/h before VAT.

As for PowerDVD, yes it has its uses as a Bluray disc viewer, *IF* you have a bluray reader (most cheap laptops don't), and *IF* you have a full version. The trial version is just that, a trial, and then you need to pay, which 90% of people won't want to do since they don't watch blurays on their laptop.

He has proven that he has our(the people) best interests in mind and seems to only release stuff that will not damage USA more than necessary.",1269
4847 :: Elected Officials Grudgingly Admit Snowden Forced This Debate On Surv...,"People need to understand that the Snowden leaks are easily separated into two broad categories: domestic surveillance and international surveillance.  

The NSA reform that just passed Congress is about one aspect of domestic surveillance (bulk metadata collection) that was the subject of the very first Snowden leak published.  When it came to light, Congress moved toward reform and a federal court ruled it was illegal. That is whistleblowing, and Snowden should be protected from any charges stemming from that leak. 

But the vast majority of Snowden's leaks fall into the latter category: international surveillance.  This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  And there's nothing illegal--much less unconstitutional, about foreign surveillance. Leaking classified information just because you personally disagree with a program is not whistleblowing. 

Snowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), (not for treason), which applies to:

>**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which ***information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

Now why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.

[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): 

>“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.”

[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):

>Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....
>
>...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.
>
>They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.

[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):

>Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. “Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,” Greenwald said. “***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***”

[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):

>I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation

So even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to ""ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China"" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.

Here's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:

> Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.
> 
> Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing. At least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that.
> 
> **But now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into China and all this kind of thing. He is going a little bit too far. I don't think he had access to that program. But somebody talked to him about it, and so he said, from what I have read, anyway, he said that somebody, a reliable source, told him that the U.S. government is hacking into all these countries. But that's not a public service, and now he is going a little beyond public service.**

> **So he is transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor.**",153

There aren't a lot of game companies whose president is a software engineer him/herself and I was proud of that fact.

I saw him up close once, when he came to NOA for an event promoting Wii Sports internally. He jogged in the room to some energy-infused music (might've been the Rocky theme?), pumping his fists high in the air along with the Wii Remote and nunchuk that he held. He got up in front of everyone and boxed against Reggie (the NOA president--I think he had just recently been appointed to the position) in Wii Boxing while a jam-packed room of employees cheered him on.

The car can react faster than a human so why not?

But that is a ways off.  They're working on a way for both self driving and regular cars to talk as well. This way a self driving or regular car would get a warning about what cars ahead of it are doing, ex. if the anti collision system in the car 3 cars ahead sees a dog run in the road and breaks, it lets the other cars know there's a dog in the road and they're breaking.  It's gonna be a  while but once better safety systems come online I bet they start driving better.

>**Important** post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking **could** compromise users’ privacy.

He call's Tim Cook's post ""important"" and says such forced hacking ""could"" compromise users' privacy. This is a very weak statement. He stops short of agreeing with what Cook said, only labeling it important, instead of correct.

>We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that’s wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. **Could** be a troubling precedent.

Could it? **Could it?** Come on, Sundar. This is bad. Call it bad.

Frankly, it's impossible to tell whether Sundar even sides with Tim Cook or the FBI because of the way the statement is phrased. I think headlines claiming ""Google takes Apple's Side"" are jumping the gun. The statement is as wishy-washy as it possibly could have been.

4803 :: IPv6 celebrates its 20th birthday by reaching 10 percent deployment,"The two key things that have caused slow IPv6 adoption (at least in ISPs) are: 

1. There was no reason to roll it out until the addresses ran out. Do you deploy a massive change to your network that will have zero customer impact (if it works) or do you deploy other network changes that will provide revenue, stability, or some other benefit?

2. Every function of every part of your network needs to support IPv6 at scale in the mode you're using it at. All ISPs networks are different, and your ISP might be the only one using that piece of kit in that way and now it needs to do the same with IPv6. Also, since IPv6 wasn't a priority when you built the network (see point 1) while you might have said you wanted it during the procurement process (since the network designers were expecting to need it soon), no one actually tested it beyond maybe a quick functional test as a part of the procurement process.",80

Well, IP makes the allowance. IPv4 doesn't. That's why you *can* run dual IPv6 and IPv4 stacks. It's not a failure of IPv4 to support only 32-bit addresses, it's a design feature. The IP stack is working exactly as specified. And if IPv4 allowed specification of arbitrary addresses, you'd still lose all the other stuff IPv6 supports that IPv4 doesn't.",27

4750 :: The first website went online 25 years ago today,"A couple of years ago I found a Next cube. I'm not going to say where it is to avoid vandalism, but this is the story.

The cube was more or less abandoned and I asked the owner if I could play with it. He was very reticent but I was more relentless and I got to play with it. He told me that Next computer belonged, at one point, to CERN and that it has not been used since then. I decided to explore it.

The first interesting thing I found was a file containing a lot of email addresses from people that seemed to work at CERN or be related to CERN in some form or fashion. The owner of the computer decided to be overly professional and deleted the file.

The second interesting thing I found completely blew my mind. There was a folder called WorldWideWeb and inside it several files called WorldWideWeb_0.1.0.tar, 0.1.1.tar, 0.2.0.tar and so on. Could this be? I opened one by one and indeed they were apps. I started with the oldest and executed them one by one.

The first one raised an error as it tried to contact cernvax.cern.ch (this Next cube was disconnected) and then it crashed: http://imgur.com/e90mCeM

I kept on going and eventually one started. It was very plain but I knew what it was. I quickly went back to my terminal, open vi, and wrote a small HTML file, which then I passed as a parameter to the little WorldWideWeb_0.2. It worked... **it displayed an h1 as a title!**.

I was jumping out of my skin. I don't want to publish the whole picture to avoid releasing private information, but I'm standing, next to the cube, pointing and what could possible be the earliest version of the web browser that still works today, displaying a web site I just coded: http://imgur.com/7efjrHT Then I discovered the browser allowed me to edit the page, directly there, without having to do anything special, and I remembered that Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally designed the web to be read-write, not read-only.

That was one of the most exciting moments of my life. When I got home I wrote an email to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, telling him of my finding and where he could find that computer, just in case he wanted to get ahold of those binaries (I couldn't find any source code anywhere on that machine). He never replied, I don't know if he ever got my email. I bet he gets a lot of it and that he's a very busy man.

>Sourceforge hosts ~440,000 projects dating back to 1999; It seems to have been the default option to host software projects for a decade or so. Many / most of those projects have been abandoned by their maintainers, and the official websites of those projects have been taken down, as continued webhosting and domain registration costs money, and a project abandoned a decade ago usually isn't judged to be worth ongoing expenses.

>In tens of thousands of cases, Sourceforge and its mirrors are the only remaining repository for applications that at one point had, or even continue to have a significant userbase. The fact that they have begun this poisonous practice of adware & malware bundling indicates they're probably not long for this world, and that means the abandoned projects Sourceforge hosts, are threatened. If Sourceforge goes down under present conditions and all the mirrors have dropped out as per the request here: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/38ebj4/dont_like_whats_happening_with_sourceforge/ , digital historians are losing access to a substantial number of entire programming languages, and the ability to read many thousands of file formats of varying obscurity, forever.

>If that happens, it will happen as a result of dealing with a transient annoyance, hijacking of & malware bundled with a few of the most popular projects which already have their own malware-free websites, without regard to preservation.

>The appropriate response is not to cut off the mirrors, but to finish the mirroring process by duplicating the content on Sourceforge itself, replacing it with a benevolent nonprofit organization. After that's done, then we can get down on our hands and knees in VMs and pick through the bundled-malware-version changelog and restore the pre-malware versions to their rightful maintainers.

4730 :: How DuPont Concealed the Dangers of the New Teflon Toxin | Chemical c...,"Chemist here. The discussion of this article, evidenced by many of the comments, suffers from confusion about what *Teflon™*, PTFE, and PFOA are. First, we're not talking about a single chemical with Teflon: it's a brand. The relevant chemicals/substance that concern is here are:

* [PFOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid), a.K.a ""C8"", a small molecule acid and [perfluorinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorinated_carboxylic_acid) (all H's on the hydrocarbon are replaced by F's) [surfactant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) — which is like soap. It's closely related to [Scotchgard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotchgard), which was phased out by 3M for household use as a result of several concerns. As i understand, it's used industrially n the production of PTFE (which in and of itself is not a problem). The question here seems to be the unknowns surrounding it's presence — or the chemicals that may have replaced it — in water streams entering into the environment.
* [PTFE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) — polytetrafluoroethylene, a plastic widely used, although largely invisible, save for non-stick coatings. It's optical, electrical, and chemical properties make it independents to modern science and industry, along with other related [fluoropolymers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoropolymer).
* [Teflon™](https://www.chemours.com/Teflon/en_US/) is a brand and trademark. Hence it can refer to a variety of materials, each with different applications and compositions, hence although it is in some just PTFE made by a particular company, it's not necessarily identical. 

So we have some terms that The Intercept and those in this discussion need to use with greater care. To be fair, it can be confusing, but these are important distinctions. 

It's also easy to see industry and those who work with them as the ""bad guys"" however in my experience with industry scientists, they have far greater concerns in the area of safety than your average member of the public.

4722 :: Denmark Just Set a Wind Power Record...Again | According to Energinet...,"In Scotland, we store surplus power (e.g. produced by wind turbines) by having it power pumps to pump water up-river, behind hydro-electric dams. When there's a deficit in power, the dams allow water down-river, powering the dam and producing hydro-power. These two things essentially turn the lochs of Scotland into enormous batteries.

Denmark's a lot flatter than Scotland though, and I presume that means it has a vastly reduced capacity for storing its surplus electricity as hydro-power. How is the surplus energy produced by the wind turbines stored there?",279

A big argument in America is not that there's anything wrong with alternative energy, but rather that it's incredibly difficult to maintain an even flow of power on the line, given that wind and solar comes and goes at irregular intervals and battery tech really isn't at a place where we can store enough excess.

Look, I'm the first to say that (with current tech) wind and solar will never be able to meet our power demands; they can only lessen the need for fossil fuels, not replace them. And I can accept that... at least until fusion power is viable. But with roughly **90000** miles of coastline, it seems to me the US is just leaving a great supplemental power source - even greater if you count tidal power - untapped.",12

First off, in a modern OS, rm -rf / shouldn't have worked like that, it should have failed. Unless you use a very specific option (--no-preserve-root). 

Secondly, when you read his comments, some things stand out.

For instance, when a user suggests to take a mirror of one of the disks to a new one, to try recovery software on it, using dd, he comments that he has accidentally switched the if and of options, and by doing so, wiped the original disk instead of making a mirror of it.

Now, i understand people make mistakes, so the initial failure (thou strange as of my first comment) is acceptable. But at this point, even if he is panicking, after reading all the comments to calm down first and checking everything at least 3 times with the manuals, he should have given the dd command a good validation before running it. 

If it is not fake: i'm sorry for him and i hope he can figure out a way to at least stay safe from the legal ramifications.

Maybe he tagged the wrong OS? Doesn't matter if he's using a Linux OS from the last 10 years (which any company of this size would be). Switching the direction of dd when your company is at stake?

Further, he asked ""how to do a backup without mounting a remote drive on the server"". He runs a company like this and doesn't know about rsync? Come on.  

Lastly, this is ""from a backup maintenance script"" and the ""rm -rf {foo}/{bar}"" clearly hadn't experienced the ""bug"" before or his company would have been gone long before. If it was a new script, why would you *ever* mount your backup drives before testing it?

You'd need seriously hardcore analytical hardware (warehouses of computers) and extremely diligent hotel staff/systems to search all businesses & hotels in France for terrorists on a rolling basis (hell, even on a weekly basis) that can crossreference to this list. Then, you'd have to find a way to surveil them. 

It's not like France has a cloud barrier that instantly sends all texts to a bunker of people reading them for context. And you can use burners, so people have no idea who is sending the text.

4640 :: The FCC is asking for comments on a proposal to require manufacturers...,"The actual rules haven't changed, from what I can see.

The FCC requires that the ""responsible party"" file for certification of the device, and obtain an FCC ID for it.

Modifications require recertification in most cases, and if the modification was not performed by the original manufacturer, the FCC ID cannot be reused for fairly obvious reasons.

Even the bit about technical measures against modification isn't exactly new, because it hasn't been a point of contention before, because radio modules were typically certified on their own, and mobile phones had dedicated ""application"" and ""baseband"" processors.

This is now changing, as integrated solutions are using unified designs. Modifying the firmware for such a design will require recertification unless people really know what they are doing.

So, software updates are prohibited except if you take responsibility. The question is why manufacturers should be required to make it hard to install such an update.

From a safety point of view, that makes a bit of sense, but I can see that it also locks me out if I am prepared to take over the certification work. So I'm still unhappy.

4604 :: Amazon employee who wrote a rebuttal to The New York Times worked 100...,"tl;dr: Your experience at Amazon entirely depends on your manager and your department, but the environment is toxic any way you slice it.

What people are missing here is that Amazon is huge and every team is completely independent in terms of how it is run.

I worked in an org where people tend to work 8 hours each day and play board games for 90 minutes during lunch and the work hours weren't so bad. I generally came in around 10:30 and would work until anywhere between 6 and 9, depending on when I felt like leaving.

However, there were teams on the same floor as me where everyone showed up at 8am, left at 7pm, and would promptly sign online and be active until 2am. No, they weren't forced to work that many hours. If they decided to work just 8 hour days it would effect their reviews and they wouldn't get promoted.

Amazon has a policy that every org has to fire their 10% worst performers. If you have a team of all-stars, your only option is to target someone on another team and do what you can to move them out. It makes the environment competitive. People that you should be friends with (considering you see them more than anyone else in your life) end up being competitors. Amazon has build a business where individual contributions matter the most and working with others gets you no where. You need to lead projects and take as much credit as you can for yourself to succeed.

Sure, some people will do well in that environment but I found it incredibly toxic.",1603

Though companies like Facebook and Netflix have instituted policies meant to improve work-life balance, long hours are still very much the norm.

Yes, some tech companies are worse than others from a work/life balance standpoint. However, Amazon has been shown to not only abuse their white collar workers (who can go to another company fairly easily), but also the blue collar warehouse workers who often don't have that option.

That's not to excuse any tech company who does that, but Amazon seems to do it across the board instead of just in certain working groups (where it's generally an issue with an insane manager or VP)",173

Drones open up a whole new realm. If they are able to fly over your backyard, and they see you engaged in some illegal activity, then is it a search or not?  There have been cases involving helicopters and how they can't just hover over your house, but I assume drones will be a bit different.

I find myself pretty skeptical of any studies run by a site called cutcabletoday.com. Seems like they might have an agenda to push. 

Reading through their article it becomes evident that the survey question they asked was ""How likely are you to be using each paid service 12 months from now?"" but they then present their results in a binary format (sure, not sure). A format which doesn't appear to conform with the relevant survey question, without some sort of manipulation of the data (not saying that's bad, just that they did something with it before presenting it). 

What's bad is that they didn't tell us anything about the treatment of the data. 

I really don't see how they get from ""how likely are you to use"" to ""don't know if they'll keep"". Seems like a leap, and I suspect the agenda of the website has something to do with it. 

Not to mention they don't release any info about their sample pool beyond sample size. Was it a phone survey? An internet survey? In person? What country? What state? Multiple states? Any one of these options will result in a different sample bias (age and income being the most obvious). The lack of any mention of this makes me extremely skeptical of the results. 

Finally, they surveyed these people in July 2014. Over a year ago. Did we see anywhere close to a 63% decline in cable subscriptions in the last year?

No.

TL;DR: This title is just clickbait to appeal to the popularity of the cable-cutting mindset among younger folks. It doesn't release any detail about its survey or data treatment methodology, and over a year later, the claims that they've made just haven't been borne out.

4544 :: Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' security,"TL;DR - Apple did not clearly state the impact of the iOS9 security improvements to those that had 3rd party repairs.

I searched error 53 on Apple's site

https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204770

Under code 53...

*Check for hardware issues

Errors: 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 53, 56, 1002, 1004, 1011, 1012, 1014, 1667, or 1669.

Your device or computer might have a hardware issue that stops the update or restore from completing.

    Check that your security software and settings aren't blocking your device from communicating with the Apple update server.
    Then try to restore your iOS device two more times while connected with a cable, computer, and network you know are good.
    Make sure that your security software and settings are allowing communication between your device and update servers.
    If you still see the error message when you update or restore, contact Apple support.

If you still see the error message, check for outdated or modified software.*

Not particularly insightful in light of current events.

The point in favor of the customer is there is no ""easy to find"" consequence (aside from nullifying the warranty and support from Apple) from having a third party repair the device. I ignored recent posts and articles on the issue just to determine if a user could reasonably determine prior to recent events the consequence of repairing an idevice through a third party. I searched through the iphone user guide, info pdf's, googled error 53, and tried sourcing other channels within Apple's web site, for anything outlining the devices would be disabled if compromised. Didn't find anything readily relevant. 

To those arguing the value of secured data - I do not doubt your argument. Technically, you're right, and it would be a reasonable course of action to protect your data. It should also be clearly disclosed.

There is no explicit physical consequence listed in the iPhone manual or related documents for having the device repaired by a third party. A customer would not get the impression the device would be disabled after reading the supplied documents. Consequences to Apple's Warranty and willingness to repair third party repaired devices at the end of warranty are described, not device bricking. The warranty is a year long, contracts can last longer, and a non warranty repair from Apple are pricey. That, and the consequence of updating a third party repaired idevice from iOS 8 to 9 is not obvious either. 

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/02/05/iphone-6-killing-error-53-highlights-big-ios-9-problem/#66b61924284a) covered the issue as well. Information posted by Apple regarding the changes to Touch id,

""[Improved security with two-factor authentication support and a default 6 digit passcode support for Touch ID devices](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1842?locale=en_US)"", that's it.

Following the Apple support link relating to the page above (for Touch ID), security information regarding changes to ""Touch ID"". If they clearly stated ""The device will be completely and permanently disabled if repaired by an unauthorized third party, and will no longer be supported in any way by Apple"" one can argue against recent complaints. It doesn't. ",21

3. Additional points of emphasis you should consider adding:

* Wireless networking research depends on the ability of researchers to investigate and modify their devices.

* Americans need the ability to fix security holes in their devices when the manufacturer chooses to not do so.

* Users have in the past fixed serious bugs in their wifi drivers, which would be banned under the NPRM.

* Billions of dollars of commerce, such as secure wifi vendors, retail hotspot vendors, depends on the ability of users and companies to install the software of their choosing.

* Mesh networking which helps first responders in emergencies, also helps provide anonymity, creates a backup/alternative communications network, will become more difficult than it needs to be with these new rules.

* Users should be able to manipulate and control all aspects of their devices. 

* Manufacures will likely employe digital locks is the easiest manner they can rather than worrying about letting you still use your device fully to the extent of the law. This means you get locked out of other things, cannot check for back doors, etc... It's cheaper to implement a lock that encompasses the entire device rather than trying to individually lock or unlock each little line of code depending on the legalities.

4480 :: Self-Filling Water Bottle Converts Humid Air into Drinkable H2O,"Engineer here.  Lemme give you the practical numbers.

Condensing moisture from humidity into water requires 9000 BTU/gal, if the air's already at the dewpoint, 100% humidity.  17 fluid ounces requires 1195 BTU to condense.

If this were the efficiency of a central air conditioner, this would use 92 watt-hrs of electricity.

But we're surely talking about Peltier solid-state cooling, which has not advanced significantly in 25 years or so.  If it did, it would be huge news.

Peltiers are like 10th the efficiency of R134a systems.  And the performance curve is really critical- if the heatsink gets significantly warm, the performance drops precipitously.  Heatsinks have to be huge to actually dissipate the wattage while not being particularly warm themselves.

So you'd need about one kilowatt-hr to make 17 ounces of water in 100% humidity conditions.  Just so you know, a fit person pedaling a generator for long periods without going anywhere will generate about 200W, so you'd need 5 hrs of work.  

Solar panel tech is about 14.5 watt per sq ft.  So to generate 1KW in 4 hours of decent sun a day, that would require over 17 sq ft of solar panels to produce the 250W output to condense 17 oz with a Peltier over the course of the day.  This doesn't make a lot of sense, you would not have that much sunlight in 100% humidity conditions.

What that shows is ""moisture farming"" is fantastically energy-intensive.  If you were going to condense water out of the air, you'd use conventional R134a/R410a refrigeration and counterflow heat exchangers.  The performance will be an order of magnitude better, but the bottom line STILL makes no sense.

If you had that much power, you'd probably find something better to do with it than making a few oz of water.  Water is a thing, but not THAT critical, and if it were, you would not have the means to be doing this sort of huge ""solution"".  Well if you're in a desert with no means of support and dying of thirst, yes 17 oz of drinking water is a big thing, but a massive, expensive solar array would not make any sense as a solution.  You need far more water than that to live and farm.

In any case, the proposal does not add up.  Nothing that size can condense 17 oz of water a day from solar, even under the most ideal conditions, however unlikely they may be.

My high school had what was basically a long computer science course and I took it. The teacher was completely unqualified and unable to complete her own assignments. We were forbidden from programming anything which wasn't specifically in our tutorial textbook. Programming any other programs was not allowed. Creativity was explicitly not allowed. One of my friends programmed a program which beeped in a loop. It was his second offense and he was suspended.

The few of us who really wanted to program a little bit for fun did so in secret and hid files carefully. To say that it stifled all of us is an understatement.

This system is called Application Insights. Microsoft announced this during the 2015 Build Conference and is not a flashy announcement so I am guessing the media never even thought about it. This system has been around for website for several years and now they are extending it to allow for monitoring most types of applications. From an application developer stand point this is a wonderful because it can track user experience and tell developers how their app is getting used and where the problems might be.

Its a service *used* by a ton of applications (including some Microsoft ones, and a great many others) to efficiently aggregate usage and diagnostic information. 

The App Insights system, to reduce load on the system, basically has a service that takes ETW logs and streams them into the application's AI instance. Its basically a local cache of data and a service to upload it, nothing more. 

What each user of it does with it is not some intrinsic evil in Windows, its what each application uses it for. I've got a few that solely use it, from a client standpoint, to report back exceptions. If AI wasn't available, I'd just be posting them up to a web endpoint like every other application out there.

Win10's client runtime includes AI support, and thus has the service pre-installed. Those runtime components are needed for backwards compatibility of newer applications onto older systems (just like having to install any of a hundred other Windows components like the MSVC runtime versions), thus the update installing it.

If nothing sends data to it, it doesn't do anything. And if any of the applications you're using need it, they'd be installing it themselves, anyway. ",284

4368 :: Young People Would Rather Have An Internet Connection Than Daylight,"Let's see... survey was done by a blinds company. First red flag. 

Secondly, most people don't understand how these surveys work. When a poll that is sponsored by an organization is conducted, it rarely asks plainly whether you like A or B. What they do instead is they ask related questions to encourage the response they're seeking. 

For instance, a Republican poll wouldn't ask voters in a swing state whether they'd vote for Hillary or Trump. Instead, they ask what voters think about Hillary's track record in Benghazi, something which the majority of people don't have a clue about but have an opinion on. Then they ask whether Trump would make a difference in the White House. Obviously they know that since people know he's brash and tactless, people would view him as less prone to corruption. So you have a box checked against Hillary and another box checked for Trump. Get a majority of boxes checked in a ""gerrymandered"" category, and you can summarize it as people preferring Trump to Hillary. 

I'd bet my firstborn child that this is exactly the kind of shenanigans going in. Obviously the sponsor of the campaign has a vested interest in getting people to vote against daylight. Plus the margin is only 5%, 64% for daylight vs 69% for Internet. What's the standard deviation on that? 

Furthermore, there are other ways to get the result you want. What constitutes young people? An 18 year old living in an orphan's home who has never experienced Internet is a young person. A refugee father who has just immigrated from Syria is also a young person. 

I'd wager that the list of options they allow you to pick from is also grotesquely skewed; they probably deliberately included something nonsensical like radio controlled cars that they know people wouldn't pick and omit breathing for instance to raise the profile of the choices they were aiming for. 

I mean, just ask yourself. Would the normal, sane person pick Internet over everlasting darkness? It just doesn't make sense.",130

That's all there is to it, encryption is a basic technology, just like locks.

Similarly it wouldn't make sense to require all locks to additionally open with one general key which thousands of government employees have access to. Of course that key would be copied within a short time and be available to criminals, and of course foreign secret services would try their hardest to get access to such a key. Which in turn provides access not just to your private pictures and correspondence, but also to trade secrets of private enterprises, and to any and all bank accounts. 
 
The result would be a disaster for the economy and for national security and that's not even considering that any actual criminals and terrorists of course continue to have access to working cryptography.

Now I wouldn't call anyone moronic for not understanding this. Nobody can know everything. However if you formulate policy for a major political party, and it doesn't even occur to you *once* to consult some actual experts on the topic ... well, then you are a moron.

This is going to cost the cable operators money which will cost us money because they don't eat costs, they pass them on to customers.

This kind of change it just a change to reserving a different kind of bandwidth within their system for TV usage than they did before. It doesn't turn it into an internet service because it doesn't go to or from the internet it's not some kind of massive cheat in that way. Its just another way of using their system to deliver TV.

I do wish the FCC would have put in some consideration that ISPs should be required to allow other video providers to colocate in their datacenters and thus also be outside caps/tiers.

>**In China, Your Credit Score Is Now Affected By Your Political Opinions – And Your Friends’ Political Opinions:**

>China just introduced a universal credit score, where everybody is measured as a number between 350 and 950. But this credit score isn’t just affected by how well you manage credit – it also reflects how well your political opinions are in line with Chinese official opinions, and whether your friends’ are, too.

>In the West, the surveillance agencies have been trying to stay as low-key as possible, while listening to everything and anything. China has taken a different approach. Not only is the surveillance very overt, you are also constantly nudged to fall in line.

>This Chinese credit score, which seemed innocent at first, was introduced this summer. More precisely, it was introduced by Alibaba and Tencent, China’s IT giants who run the Chinese equivalents of all social networks, and who therefore have any and all data about you. People can download an app named “Sesame Credit” from the Alibaba network, and the score has become something of a bragging contest, being interpreted as a kind of “citizen status” – and not entirely falsely so. Almost 100,000 people have posted their “status” online on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

>[Sesame Credit Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nx06uPZ.jpg)

>A screenshot from the Sesame Credit app, showing score 698 on a scale from 350 to 950.In the West, our credit score is simple. It’s our ability to pay. It’s measured from our assets, our income, and if we have bought on credit in the past and managed it well. That’s it. In China, the situation is… more nuanced. It’s not just that you have bought things, it’s also what you buy that contribute to your credit score, in either direction. If you’re buying things that the regime appreciates, like dishwashers and baby supplies, your credit score increases. If you’re buying videogames, your score takes a negative hit.

>Anybody can check anybody’s credit score using the site Credit China, which again helps people disconnect from people who significantly draw down your own credit score: they’re listed as such. All 869,582 of them.

>In theory, Sesame Credit (and its benefits) is optional. So far. For the time being. But China has already announced that it, or something very like it, will become mandatory from 2020. It has also announced that while there are benefits today for obedient people, it intends to add various sanctions for people who don’t behave, like limited Internet connectivity. Such people will also be barred from serving in certain high-status and influential positions, like government official, reporter, CEO, statistician, and similar.

>Things that will make your score deteriorate include [posting political opinions without prior permission](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/us-china-internet-idUSKBN0KM1F320150113), talking about or describing a [different history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989) than the official one, or even publishing [accurate up-to-date news](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/investing/china-arrests-markets-crash/) from the Shanghai stock market collapse (which was and is embarrassing to the Chinese regime).

>But the kicker is that if any of your friends do this — publish opinions without prior permission, or report accurate but embarrassing news — your score will also deteriorate. And this will have a direct impact on your quality of life.

>“Sesame Credit, however, also uses other data to calculate the scores, such as a person’s hobbies, interaction with friends, shopping habits and lifestyle.” — Quote from China Daily Asia

>The KGB and the Stasi’s method of preventing dissent from taking hold was to plant so-called agents provocateurs in the general population, people who tried to make people agree with dissent, but who actually were after arresting them as soon as they agreed with such dissent. As a result, nobody would dare agree that the government did anything bad, and this was very effective in preventing any large-scale resistance from taking hold. The Chinese way here is much more subtle, but probably more effective still.

>This scheme is far more sinister than it seems at first, as you’re also getting assorted immediate privileges based on this credit score:

>If your credit score reaches 600, you have the privilege of an instant loan of about $800 without collateral when shopping online.

>At a score of 650, you may rent a car without leaving a deposit.

>At 700, you get access to a bureaucratic fast track to a Singapore travel permit.

>And at 750, you get a similar fast track to a coveted Schengen visa.

>There are many more examples – these are just to illustrate.

>Do you see what’s happening here? This means that people need to choose between that coveted European vacation and keeping in touch with their old friends who are disagreeing with the regime’s opinions openly. This means that staying in touch with dissidents will cause you and your family to lose out on social benefits. As a result, this will very effectively isolate and neuter anybody who posts unofficial political opinions or unofficial history facts. They’ll effectively be sent into social exile, based on everything they do, write, think, and discuss online.

>What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking. This may not be the purpose, indeed I doubt it’s the primary purpose, but it’s nevertheless the effect of giving only obedient people the social ability to have children, not to mention successful children.

>People sometimes mock the notion that we’re not at a 1984 level yet. I wonder what it’ll really take to make such people realize that the 1984 point of surveillance has long come and gone.

Also, from the plot, it's not that good of a pseudocapacitor?  50 F/g capacitance is lower than you would get for many double layer capacitors, which already can achieve very long cycle lives.  There are pseudocapacitors out there that get over 10x higher capacitance - that higher capacitance is the whole reason to make a pseudocapacitor (though the energy density is still well below that of batteries).

A simple description of the difference between a battery, an electric double-layer capacitor, and a pseudocapacitor is that a battery has charge-transfer reactions occurring deep within the electrode materials used, a double-layer capacitor has no charge-transfer reactions occurring (charges just ""stick"" to the surface), and a pseudocapacitor has both charge-transfer reactions at the surface of the material and charges ""sticking"" to the surface.  In general, the less you mess with the material, the longer it lasts (since you're not constantly shifting stuff into or out of it, and thus as giving it fewer chances to break) and the more power you can get from it (since it's easier to move stuff from a surface than it is to move stuff from deep inside a material).  However, at the same time, you can store less energy because you're just utilizing the surface and not the surface plus the interior.  I would generally think of pseudocapacitors as sort of a ""compromise technology"" that gives up some of the lifespan of double-layer capacitors in order to reach higher energy densities.

Also, I'm not saying this paper is bad research or anything.  It's cool how much they've extended the cycle life, and it's possible that similar techniques might be applied to higher-capacity systems to enable longer cycle lives.  It's just important to keep in mind that the actual research and what's in the hyped-up article about the research are different things.

Edit #2: I'll also note (having realized that the paper is actually open-access - I had assumed at first that it was not available, since I'm not currently somewhere with journal access) that it looks like the capacity at lower scan rates (more or less translating to, at lower currents) is not so much lower than normal as I'd initially believed.  Generally people include the highest capacity value achieved during their tests in their abstract or front plot, but these folks did not.",748

"4309 :: AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable Implicated In Content Delivery Netwo...","This is a peering dispute. Let's break down AT&T statement:

> “It would be unprecedented and unjustified to force AT&T to provide free backbone services to other backbone carriers and edge providers, as Cogent et al seek,”

I suspect, if we saw enough of the details, that this would look a lot like the Verizon / Level 3 peering dispute. If so, there's no seeking of free backbone services. GTT is merely attempting to deliver data requested by AT&T customers and AT&T is refusing it. Two obvious reasons to do that would be to attempt to get paid twice for that traffic and to hurt competing services (video that competes with their own TV service).

> “Nor is there any basis for requiring AT&T to augment network capacity for free and without any limits.""

AT&T should not sell 10 Mbps service if it refuses to augment its network enough to provide that service. That's Internet service provider 101 - don't sell more capacity than you can provide.

> Opponents’ proposals would shift the costs of their services onto all AT&T subscribers, many of whom do not use Opponents’ services, and would harm consumers.”

It's AT&T that is attempting to shift the cost of their network to other companies on the Internet. When GTT has an increase in traffic on their backbone or at a peering point, they increase the bandwidth at the congested point. AT&T should do that same. And if AT&T doesn't think it fair that light users pay the same as heavy users, they're arguing against their own pricing policy.",363

Yes there is. The entire internet is the fucking precedent.

There will always be sides that have to offer more data than they are receiving. But to the people interacting with said services, that is exactly as expected. Webservers in general have put out more data than they have received since the dawn of time. Same with newsgroups and bulletin boards.

In the end, you have customers that pay you expecting to give them **unhindered internet access**. If you do not expand your ability to provide said access, you are not living up to your side of the contract. Worse, you want to receive _more_ money.

This situation can be easily compared to simple infrastructure. Suppose business is booming in a neighboring town, but the majority of people live in your own. This causes a lot of traffic. NeighborTown is really happy with the money that's flowing in, but ThisTown is seeing precious tax dollars escaping them. To incentivize businesses to move to their town instead, they make it really had for the employees to do their daily traveling by actively blocking proposals to widen the roads and otherwise improve infrastructure. The people who are really the victims of this are **the people living in ThisTown**. They have to wake up earlier for traffic and go home later. They may lose their jobs when YetAnotherTown can provide a workforce that can service NeighborTown more adequately. They may be forced to move to make things meet, giving up on their dreamhouse.

Worst of all, **ThisTown is supposed to have the best interests of its citizens at heart**.

This shit is screwed up. If you provide infrastructure, you aim to meet the everyones needs. That is your job, and if you think that your own profits have become too important to do the job you are supposed to make your living with, then you are too fucking big, and need to be castrated by government before your mentality gets the entire fucking industry pregnant on hormones.

False. You gave us a contract for data at a certain speed. There was no cap on it. Now you're changing your policy, prices aren't being reduced, and we get a worse product out of it. How is this good for the customer, and how is this fair?

Also, the reason I hate Comcast is because of the bullshit limitations on their products. Want to watch a show on the computer? Oops, sorry, thats only available on TV. Want to watch a football game that's on in Pittsburgh, but not on in Baltimore? Sorry, can't do it. You wanna know why people are moving away from cable? It's because the system is designed to be overly profitable for the broadcast companies, overly profitable for the cable company, and designed to fuck the consumer in the ass.

If they gave me bandwidth speeds that didn't suck satan's dick for the price they charge me, I would be all for it. But we are now in 2015, and I still have a 10 mbps upload speed.

"4316 :: ""Stanford researchers have developed the first lithium-ion battery th...","The important distinction is that they came up with thermal protection that cuts off power at the electrodes inside of the cells.   

Li-ion/po batteries are almost always used with thermal cut-offs, temperature sensors, and similar protections.  These work fine until the failure happens inside of the battery cells themselves.

For example on of the massive laptop battery recalls was due to a manufacturing defect that allowed the batteries to develop internal shorts in between the layers inside of the cell.  Laptop batteries have at least two separate redundant protection systems.  These didn't stop the fires because the failure happened inside of the cells.

Their invention is to coat the electrodes with a nano material that will turn from a conductor into an insulator when heated.  This cuts off the electron flow at the electrodes inside of the battery to stop thermal run away.  This is great and it will solve the problem of internal cell failures leading to fires.

My only thought on this technology is that you really don't want it to reset.  If a system is designed and operating correctly this condition should never happen outside of catastrophic failure.  If a catastrophic failure happens the system should stay offline until repaired and not cycling between protect mode and catastrophic failure until the protections or something else fails.",268

So, let's look at the hypothesis that ""Google self-driven cars are no more or less safe than self-driven cars"".  

In other words, a bunch of average American driver racking up a total of a  million miles is ""expected"" to be involved in about 2 accidents.  This is not much different from Google.

4268 :: Tech leaders give $5 million to build 100 new SF apartments to house ...,"Let's be clear about what's going on here.  Hint:  it's not a project to build 100 new SF apartments to house homeless veterans.

The Mission Rock initiative is a $1.6 billion development planned for 22 acres of currently undeveloped waterfront property south of the Giants' stadium.  The plan includes 1-2 million square feet of commercial space (including a new Anchor brewery on Pier 48), 8 acres of open space, and up to 1500 residential units.

The residential portion of the project is projected to cost about $50 million, which is about 3% of the total development cost.  Those residential units will be in two 240' tall high-rise towers that will occupy the northeast and southeast corners of the land.

The Giants are trying to get a measure onto the November ballot to approve this project, which otherwise will encounter a number of significant obstacles, notably the city's height limitations on waterfront development, and SF activists' opposition to developments that don't include adequate below-market housing.

To be a little less objective:

The deal you're reading about today is part of this political campaign, as is the glossy full-color mailer I received yesterday extolling the virtues of the project.  

Given the scale of the development, the amount of land and resources allocated to housing seems absurdly low to me.  It will make the Giants a ton of money, to be sure, but the project would certainly be profitable if they doubled or tripled the amount of housing it included.  (Indeed, if you look at the history of this project, the number of residential units keeps nosing up as the plan's backers try to find a palatable number.  Pricey though residential real estate in SF may be, commercial real estate on the waterfront is solid gold.  They'd build this 100% commercial if they could.)

Does SF need a new huge commercial development?  Well...kinda.  Commercial real estate is in short supply here, what with the tech boom and all.  But for the next decade or two, the city needs development that's heavy on residential and light on commercial, not the other way around.  Increasing the ratio of commercial to residential in SF just makes the city's problems worse.

The other thing to pay attention to here is the amount of money involved in the development:  $1.6 billion.  Do not expect that money to be spent transparently, and expect the entire board of supervisors to support the initiative sooner or later.

**Edit:**  Oh, in the context of this, consider what a master stroke it is to get philanthropists to give you $5 million to cover the costs of something that you were going to need to build anyway.",59

4268 :: Tech leaders give $5 million to build 100 new SF apartments to house ...,"san fran has a substantial homeless problem for those who haven't lived or traveled there.  you walk around the main squares and the place is crawling with a plethora of interesting people, sometimes good, sometimes a bit frightening.  the problems come in with some of the homeless, of whom some appear to be schizophrenic and some probably psychopaths (in the literal, non-judgmental definition (no empathy)).  It's a pronounced experience if you haven't been, hundreds of homeless are just off the main drags.  I have been rushed by a guy in army fatigues with a 5 inch blade only to be stopped by a bit of quick de-escalation and a friend who was carrying (plain cloths) and other police that moved in quickly.  the guy backed down but he meant serious business with a few tense moments.  this was at one of the fire-dance events, a monthly event that draws hundreds.  not fun to have an insane person rushing at you in the midst of music, lights, fire, etc at 10pm, fearing for your life in a main square.

this is a nice gesture by the execs but it's really a larger problem.  part of the issue is SF's temperate climate; it's quite lovely most of the year.  you can comfortably live outside, translation: many of the streets reek of urine and nothing's changed in a while.  I feel more comfortable in most parts of NYC than many of the wonderful sub-districts of SF (i trust nyc's more and no the limits there / sf i am often surprised block to block).  I usually carry a proDSLR when walking, and having been to SF many times for meetings, the preponderance of people on the street who watch you carefully has made me nervous.  Especially at night, i've found this to be true.  

So, nice move but self-interested in a way as SF is base for many a tech conference, and there's quite a bit of disparity between main streets and side ones in 'safety' feel.  unfortunately, income disparity, homeless, drug-use, probably a complex problem with no simple solution.  few thoughts.  hopefully more capital will be raised to help those in need in and around the city.",18

It isn't much -- let's say $0.33/month.  Over a year that's only $4.

They build the logistics of notifying the class and filing the suit, and they roll the dice that the cable company might win.

I'm not here to defend *this* particular settlement, but the reason it settled for so little is right there in the article. I won't get into the nuances of class actions, but there are two things you must know:

1. Until a class is certified (by the court; a class can only be certified if it meets certain standards), it is only a putative class action. Before a class is certified, the case is whoever the named plaintiffs are against the Defendant (an ""individual case"").

2. Many types of violations are not viable to bring as individual cases, which is why attorneys bring them as class case. For example, 20 million people defrauded out of $1 each. Suing over $1 for one person is not viable. Suing over $20m as a class of 20m people is viable.

On to why this settled like it did:

>Google has faced similar claims over Gmail scanning. Koh also oversaw that case but denied class certification to the plaintiffs. After the 9th Circuit upheld Koh's ruling, the case settled in less than two weeks.

The 9th Circuit upheld Koh's ruling in mid-2014. This case against Yahoo was filed in 2013. 

So, basically, here's what happened:

2013: Plaintiff's counsel: ""That case against Gmail looks good. I hear Yahoo is doing the same thing. Let's sue them.""

2014: Plaintiff's counsel: ""Shit, class cert denied in case against Gmail. By the same judge we have. Not good.""

One day later: Yahoo's counsel: ""So, plaintiffs counsel, we defeated a motion for class cert on nearly identical facts in front of this same judge. That's likely going to happen here. We can settle now, throw some money at you and make changes to our policies, or we can fight, defeat your motion for class cert, and give nobody anything.""

Put simply: the case looked good when filed, but it went awry when the judge who had these cases sided with defendants on class certification.

Yahoo was never going to pay the class any money once class cert was denied in Gmail. While it's easy to ask a lawyer to fall on his or her sword and take no money if the class recovers no money, such a decision could be absolutely devastating to a law firm. Not saying that's what happened here, but I have seen it happen (more along the lines of a lawyer losing a big class case and nearly, or actually, going under).

Of course, it's conceivable that the lawyers could have said ""Nay! Take that $4m and give it to the class!"" But I don't think Yahoo would have done that. Paying the class is a lot more expensive (costs of providing notice to the class, actually disbursing the checks) than paying a lawyer in one check. Notice costs can go well into the millions.

It's also important to remember that no one lawyer is walking out of here with $4m. While only two firms are listed, I'm sure there were dozens of attorneys and other firms involved.

Anyway, my point isn't that this is a good settlement. It's a bad settlement when looked at in a vacuum. But Judge Koh's ruling in gmail sapped Plaintiff of virtually all of its leverage. Under the circumstances, there likely wasn't much more that could be done.

ETA: Also, the settlement must be approved by the court. And if you're a class member and you think it's a bad settlement, you can literally go to court and object to the settlement.",40

4194 :: Indian Patent Office Says No to Software Patents,"This sounds quite similar to the European approach.

This has resulted in availability of generics, which are prized way lower than the patented drug.

We start teaching kids about the Internet and technology in like 1st grade so that they'll be prepared and know what stuff to avoid.  
It's scary how many people don't know a thing about technology but still use it all the time.  
  
Edit: I should elaborate on what I mean by ""stuff to avoid"".  
Stuff to avoid is a pretty wide category in which I'd include porn (although that always seems to finds a way), malware, viruses, gore, shady people, giving away personal information, uploading pictures of yourself, and one more thing.  
That one more thing is **disinformation**!  
We didn't learn about source criticism in school until like 7th grade and that is way too late in today's society.  
Kids are very easily manipulated and gullible. Give them access to a bunch of racist and misleading blogs and they'll believe almost anything they read on it. We need to start teaching kids at a pretty early age that people lie and that you shouldn't trust what you read on the Internet.

The actual interview was on this blog:

http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html

>— I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming. He doesn’t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: “The whole system is collapsing. You don’t see someone who’s 90 years old and it’s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The whole system is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.” Now with anyone else—literally anyone else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk fixes shit for humanity. So what did I do?

>Me: Well…but isn’t this important enough to try? Is this something you’d ever turn your attention to?

>Elon: The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.

>Me: You’re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.

>Elon: You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it’s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don’t know.

>Me: I think there’s a way. You’ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that’s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it’s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.

>Elon: I mean I do think there’s…in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That’s the only way to do it.

>Me: And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.

It was then copied in the US that became the most aggressive activists for racial purity. The US was the first country to create an administration for tracking unfit people and preventing them to reproduce. They also volontarily killed ""by neglience"" tousands a year in mental hospitals.

Germany only improved the US methods and applied then at a much larger scale. Mein Kampf just copied the writtings of US eugenists, with less focus on blacks (they were not numerous in mainland Germany).

* Youtube.com/lush & youtube.com/user/Lush originally belonged to this dude.
* In 2014, youtube allowed users to rename their channels (sweet!).
* End 2014, youtube introduced a new youtube.com/c/Lush user url format (not many knew about this).
* The new URL format also OVERWRITES where the  youtube.com/Username points to, (but not youtube.com/User/Username - which remains the same).
* Youtube accounts are now linked to Google+ pages!!!
* The Youtube.com/c/Username is given ""by an algorithm"" to whomever has the google.com/+Lush page (the cosmetics company, with 40,000 G+ fans in this case).
* FYI: Lush the youtuber has 900,000 youtube subscribers.
* All Lush cosmetics had to do was click one of the many prompts to claim their new youtube url, and they received youtube.com/c/Lush -- which is fine (and not their fault at all).
* **The crazy part is that Youtube then overwrites where the old youtube.com/Username points to!!! It does this in all cases.**

Not that this is fair in any way, but if the guy had got his G+ page a custom URL, and linked his youtube & google+ pages, this *might* have been avoided.

3775 :: What Happens When You Talk About Salaries at Google,"@EricaJoy's salary transparency experiment at Google

a thing bothered me yesterday and it's still bothering me today and so now i want to tell a story.

One Sunday, some former coworkers & I were bored, talking about salaries on the internal social network instance. A spreadsheet was created. we put our salaries in the sheet, realized that it was created on a public to the world spreadsheet, so I copied it to internal. I then put a form on it and posted the link to the form and the spreadsheet on my internal social network account.

It took off like wildfire.

It got reshared all over the place. People started adding pivot tables that did spreadsheet magic that highlighted not great things re: pay. I did some general housekeeping stuff to the sheet (normalizing the gender field where it could be, exchange rate stuff, that sort of thing).

More reshares.

More people adding pay.

It became a thing.

I was invited to talk to my manager on Mon or Tues. Higher up people weren't happy. She wasn't happy. Why did I do it? ""Don't you know what could happen?"" Nothing. It's illegal to retaliate against employees for sharing salaries. ""Wellll...."".

Meeting ended.

Sheet kept going.

People were thanking me for it. They were also sending me peer bonuses. here's how peer bonuses work @ former co:

If you did something good, someone peer bonuses you, you get $150 net in your next paycheck. An important thing I learned during that time: peer bonuses are rewarded at managers discretion. My manager was rejecting all of them. Wasn't sure if this would be good for the company. Wanted to see what the outcome was. Mind you once a PB is rejected, that can't be undone.

Meanwhile, one of the other people involved, a white dude (good friend I won't name, he can name himself if he wants), was also getting PBs. His weren't getting rejected. I told him mine were. He was pissed. Wanted to tell everyone what was happening. I declined. A smattering of people knew what was going on. Backchannels being what they are at former co. (lol IRC #yallknowwhoyouare), it got around. Rejecting PBs was so unheard of, ppl didn't know it was possible. There was outrage when they found out. Shock that I wasn't talking abt it. Meanwhile, spreadsheet still going, getting spread around, pointed questions being thrown at mgmt about sharing salary ranges (hahah no). Most people agreed that it was A Good Thing. PBs kept rolling in. Rejections kept rolling out. One PB eventually got approved. Way after everything died down. Because the person worded it in a way that was vary vague. Any that were outright about the spreadsheet got rejected. 7 total in the end I think?

Higher ups still pissed. Some I used to support as an exec tech would pointedly not interact w/ me anymore. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Before I left, about 5% of former co. had shared their salary on that sheet. People asked for & got equitable pay based on data in the sheet. The world didn't end. Everything didn't go up in flames because salaries got shared. But shit got better for some people.

I explicitly gave ownership of the sheet to someone else before I left so it couldn't be taken over by mgmt when I was gone (can happen).

I am thinking of this because of everyone celebrating the fact that Google put Ida B. Wells in the doodle yesterday. Ida B. Wells was great. She did stuff to affect change of such a magnitude that if I'm half the woman she was, I'm doing pretty good. I don't claim to come close, but from time to time, I do stuff that will make things better for people at the expense of the establishment. I'm a pretty big believer in justice and fairness and will fight for both if necessary. Fighting for justice & fairness INSIDE Google doesn't go over well. Salary sharing is only 1 example. Blogger porn. Real names. Many others. Shit WILL hit the fan if you tell a racist (a well documented racist) to go fuck themselves though. In defense of the racist, obvi. So sure. Rah rah, Google did an Ida B. Wells doodle. Guaranteed that if Ida Wells were alive & working at Google today, there'd be many private calendar meetings focused on ""her future"" there.

tl;dr the sharing of one doodle does not a bastion of support for justice and civil disobedience make.",2675

3775 :: What Happens When You Talk About Salaries at Google,"Being in management means you see the injustice of salary.  And most of the time you inherit the disparity.  

I remember trying to correct it and being told that it was not a problem that we were hiring in new people for as much or more than the core resource of the group, who had worked for the company for nearly 30 years.  That was just how these things work.  

I spent 5 years working every possible raise I could get approved into her salary in order to get her into a range that made me not embarrassed to look her in the eye at a review.  I never succeeded in getting her paid what she was worth.

That entire thing would NEVER have happened with transparency.  Transparency forces a company to keep equity or justify adequately all inequity. 

But under the carpet inequity works in favor the of the company.  It means they can hire ""competitively"".  Its hidden in the concept of meritocracy.  But very few salaries seem to correlate to the contribution of the employee, in my experience.

If a connection invitation is not accepted within a certain period of time, up to two ""reminder emails"" are sent reminding the recipient that the connection invitation is pending. The Court found that members consented to importing their contacts and sending the connection invitation, but did not find that members consented to LinkedIn sending the two reminder emails. The Plaintiffs contend that LinkedIn members did not consent to the use of their names and likenesses in those reminder emails.

The ISP can't reasonably guarantee certain download/upload speeds to sites it doesn't control, over links that it doesn't own.

Look at Falcon Heavy - it's been 2 years away every year since 2011. 

But that's what they're good at - building this image and persona and following, and from it they can dangle the carrot in front of followers with big promises all the while obscuring problems and their own shortfalls. In particular, they are big at selling how innovative they are to the crowd that deems themselves tech savvy, but may not have in depth knowledge of the actual technology or industry.

Take for instance, the aerospace industry. SpaceX reputation within it isnt as great as it is to outsiders. It's interesting that both Musk and Jobs are known to have abrasive personalities and push their workers hard. SpaceX alone has had multiple lawsuits filed against them for working conditions these last few years. 

Yet people keep wanting to work for them, because of the reputation/larger than life persona they've built. Thus as workers burn out, quit, or leave due to working conditions, the hype train keeps pulling in the next group willing to work more for less.

3696 :: Solar Prices to Reach $1 per Watt Target 3 Years Early,"Solar Guy here. The pricing in this article is directly referring to utility scale projects. The average cost/watt for residential solar in 2010 was around $5/watt. The average price in central Texas is now around $3.20/watt. The average price last year was also around $3.20/watt. The prices of solar modules stalled after the Chinese tariff. I have noticed cheaper solar modules on the market lately but there is usually a catch such as not having a ul listing or the company is out of business.

A good american module like solarworld costs about .95/watt. A decent quality Chinese module is around .75/watt and sunpower is closer to 1.65/watt.

Now is the definitely the time to buy but I am obviously a bit biased. The Federal Tax Credit could expire next year if politicians don't extend it. Don't be that guy calling me on December 2016 because it will be too late and every company in town will be back logged.

3673 :: Windows 10 Worst Feature Installed On Windows 7 And Windows 8,"1. The host file has been ignored for a long time by microsoft tools / services last I checked.

2. Most if not all Privacy concerns can be handled by shutting the tools off

3. You can set up a local account instead of a Microsoft account

And that is a good start. If you are very paranoid, go into your router and put network level blocks on all IP's and domains microsoft uses (*.microsoft.* is a good start).

>the clear benefit of Windows 7 and Windows 8 at this point is updates are not mandatory.

If you want privacy, security is key - and for security to be valid, you need security patches. Being many people failed to update their systems regularly, perhaps this is actually not a terrible idea. A few people I know have purchased and are happily using windows 10 devices without issue. In fact, they are happy that the Updates just kinda happen in the back ground, and let them get back to work.

Could the tools for setting install times be better? Yes - Say on next restart, or next shutdown would be a good time to do it. Shutdown => Install => Soft start to configure => Power off would be a good process for it to follow, and would be user friendly. Being able to have soft service restarts without requiring the machine to reboot to install would also be beneficial.

And then finally about privacy - many people use the following:

- Facebook

- Google Search

- Gmail

- Youtube

- Reddit

- Wikipedia

- Amazon

- Twitter

And so goes the list. Each and everyone of these websites is tracking you in some way or other. Perhaps not directly - but indirectly, I can guarantee it happens. What people are talking about is useful information, even if you can't put a name and face to the content.

If you are complaining about privacy but do not sanitize your data before posting (stripping name, locations, faces, local connections and social circles, gps data and so on) - You are plastering your life WILLFULLY on the internet. Complaining about Microsoft grabbing (most likely) anonymized, sanitized data to understand what services, tools and so forth that the average person uses and how they use it - is kind of pointless.

If you do have a problem with the tracking that is done - A few things to do:

- Shut off every setting in windows 10 that states it sends data to microsoft

- Black list every IP / domain that microsoft uses for their services - EXCEPT for the core update service (using a router or other NAT device)

And you are done. Microsoft will no longer have a feasible way of tracking you. But really, just go and install Ubuntu or another Linux distro with a healthy community and support. If you browse the internet, and do some emails - it will do everything you need it to, and then some. Especially with the slow but steady movement of SteamOS and the drive towards better Linux Drivers and hardware support.

But even then - your ISP is tracking you.

**TL;DR**

If you are worried about tracking, do the research, get the tools in order and do something about it - It's more then possible these days. But if you plaster your life on Facebook, stop being a hypocrite - you are willfully providing people the means to know everything about you. And I'd wager Facebook would sell everything they know about you to any and every company that offers a high enough price.",1049

Story time: I used to be at a student at, and then later an IT employee for, a private university. It was in the PERFECT location to construct cell antennas: the campus had the tallest buildings around for miles, we already had a robust fiber infrastructure, and it was right in the middle of a large residential area that \*surprise\* had horrible Verizon cell service. Students and staff with Verizon phones that were inside ANY buildings on campus did not have any signal (no, i dont mean 1 bar. i mean straight up ""no service""). \*Surprise\* AT&T and Sprint both knew the location benefits of the university and had already negotiated to put a tower on one of the school's buildings, so everyone on campus, inside or outside of buildings (even concrete basements built in the 40s) would have service, plus it served the surrounding community.

Our IT department and VP leadership tried to get Verizon to install a tower, we even offered up the tallest building. *They wanted US to pay for it*. So we told them to get lost, and in the meantime they couldn't find another location to install a tower in the dense residential area",38

This is the largest danger of not having NN. ISPs won't directly attack the established services by blocking or throttling as that will cause a backlash. Instead they set the pattern for a racket where they demand a cut of the revenue made on the Internet. New services won't be able to pay this troll toll and they'll just wither on the vine.

3575 :: The European Union Parliament just dealt a major blow to net neutrality,"Just to make it clear: they voted FOR net neutrality rules, but didn't approve amendments that would close some 'loopholes' that could maybe possibly lead to abuses. However, it remains very much to be seen if any ISP would dare to abuse these loopholes, because they can be sued if they don't adhere to the intention of net neutrality laws.

To be more concrete: one possible loophole is an exemption for special services like remote medical procedures or self-driving cars, and an ISP could try to label their own streaming service as a specialised service to undercut competition. However, they would need to give a damn good reason why their service qualifies as specialised service while the competition doesn't, and it's very likely they would be sued for breaking the rules.

So I have to wait several days for the money to get in to PayPal and then transfer it back to my bank. Then, a day or two later, another transaction shows up showing PayPal sent the money back to my bank account as well. 

My PayPal account at this point had gone from $0 (I wasn't using it) to $1000, then back to $0, then to -$1000. After saying they couldn't do anything, they also moved the funds back to my bank. Money that in theory, did not exist, because I had already moved it.

If you have, say, $5,000 in your Paypal account and there is a dispute about $50, Paypal will gladly freeze your entire account. Actually, a dispute is not required to freeze your account, just some algorithm in their system is enough. 

So you say, just don't let your account get that high a balance. For someone with a lot of sales, that's easier said than done. And that won't protect you anyway. If they want to do a chargeback, they'll just take it out of your checking/savings account. You think draining THAT account will protect you? Think again. Paypal will just make multiple attempts to withdraw the money anyway, and you'll rack up huge overdraft fees.

If you have a checking/savings account attached to your Paypal account and you're not an active seller, remove it. That is your only protection.",14

3546 :: Adblock Plus is now letting ads by Google and Microsoft pass through ...,"Not news - Adblock Plus has been allowing non-intrusive ads for years to drive ad networks to be less annoying for all .. and earn themselves some money while at it.

An example of non-intrusive ads that Adblock Plus allows are the reddit ads. The default installation of Adblock Plus whitelists them as non-intrusive. And because reddit is not a huge ads serving company this did not cost reddit anything.

**Update:** After posting as one of the first, on something I thought everyone and their cat already knew about, this blew up (it's on the frontpage now) , so it seems that even though this is very old news, a lot of people haven't heard about it or they just like to get outraged.  
And so for all you guys.. please lower your pitchforks while I go into further details:

“Allow non-intrusive advertising” was added to Adblock Plus with version 2.0 - which came out in [December 2011](https://adblockplus.org/releases/adblock-plus-20-released). Yes almost 4 years ago - that is how old news this is.

It's not a thing that Adblock Plus have been trying to sneak by you. It mentions this on the front page of the [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), it is in it's list of features, it mentions it on the extension pages in both Firefox and Chrome, during installation and it's available as a setting that you can toogle if you don't want to allow these ads.

Adblock Plus has a [FAQ about this on their website](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads).

From this feature in Adblock Plus it has grown to become an [Internet manifesto](https://acceptableads.org/) with other companies and organizations (reddit being one of them) supporting it and promising to work towards an Internet where the ads that the sites need to generate income and survive are not annoying but are relevant to the site or content you are reading.

Try disabling your adblocker now and refresh reddit to see what qualifies as a non-intrusive ads here on reddit.  
It's easy to think that nothing has changed because the ads are really that non-intrusive, but look to the sidebar on the right and scroll down.

You will find a 300 by 250 pixel image, that usually advertises a small but upcoming subreddit that you might not have discovered, or a reddit meetup or a new reddit Secret Santa or something else that is relevant to the reddit community. Sometimes it's just some picture of a cute kitten .. *awww kitten :)* - many of these are coming from the /r/NonAds/ subreddit.  

On occasion it's even an actual product, that you can discuss here on reddit and either say how much you hate or love it, but most of the time it's reddit community content that you are missing out on if you turn off the whitelisting of reddit.com

I think it's good that someone is trying to find a compromise between showing ads and allowing users some peace of mind and privacy, instead of scamming them and annoying the hell out of everyone.  
And if you don't agree then it can easily be turned off so all ads are removed.

Now you might think that I recommend you stay with Adblock Plus - I'm not.  
You SHOULD switch - but not because of the non-intrusive ads feature but because Adblock Plus is a memory hog.  
That said Firefox 41 was just released and it introduces [a feature that will greatly reduce the memory overhead of Adblock Plus](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2015/07/01/firefox-41-will-use-less-memory-when-running-adblock-plus/).  
Even so I suggest you switch to uBlock Origin which is just as good at removing ads as Adblock Plus but is faster and uses much less memory.

But since you already have your pitchforks out .. there is actually something to get outraged about here.  
Because while Yahoo is trying to anger you against Adblock Plus (to make people distrust adblockers no doubt) and their acceptable ads feature, they are at the same time serving some of the worst ads for scams I have seen on a mayor network.

I tried turning off my adblocker on that Yahoo ""news article"" and I'm hit with clickbait ads for scams like ""EXPOSED: *[subject hometown here]* Mum Makes *[subject currency and huge amount here]*/Month From Home And You Won't Believe How She Does It! "" - as it turns out all you have to do is order this easy starter kit for the low low price of *[your soul]* and you can be making EASY money from home without any real work.

It's been a long time since Yahoo was a relevant company that was beneficial to the Internet - now they just serve dubious articles with content they borrowed from other sites, and then serve you lots of clickbait and ads.

Saying Adblock Plus sold out to Google, while Yahoo themselves sold out to scammers is the worst kind of hypocrisy.

**Fuck you Yahoo!**

Capitalism depends on the economics of scarcity. We're already stretching it to its limits with the concept of intellectual property and digital ownership, things which are by their nature *not scarce*.

What do you think is going to happen when you automate 80+% of labor? There will be no demand for unskilled labor. Imagine if everyone had to get Masters degrees in order to find employment? It doesn't work. If you're going on the US system where you have to enter into debt to get an education, then you're creating an even deeper hole and effective serfdom. If you're going the European system and socializing education, then you're setting up a welfare system just short of basic income in order to create a working class.

Capitalism and ""peak automation"" are fundamentally incompatible. If you don't begin converting to a socialist society now, you're going to see extreme poverty and an economic depression unlike any before in history. ",479

"3492 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...",">First, unlike Tesla, it's not all of its patents, but rather a specific portfolio of electric vehicle patents.

The announcement specifically stated it was just their electric vehicle patents. 

Also, this was just announced yesterday, so to then make a big post about how it's not true at all when it probably hasn't been fully implemented yet is a bit ridiculous.",2582
"3492 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...","Hi, I wrote the original article that made it to the front page yesterday and I disagree. Actually, I think this article is a lot more misleading by saying that ""Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla"". Ford is clearly opening its patents. Not exactly like Tesla, but they still are making them accessible.

**Big companies don't always license their patents like OP's article is suggesting.** They actually often use their patents to block competitors from developing similar technologies. Ford is saying they will not do that, instead they will work with others.

BTW, if Tesla was to help competitors implement their tech, I'm pretty sure they would ask to be compensated too. When you license your tech, normally you lends some engineers familiar with the tech to help implement it to the product. The difference is that Tesla made it clear that if someone were to use their tech, in good faith, they wouldn't sue. In other words, they will not use patents for their technology slowing capability. Ford didn't make that clear.

But the most important thing to take away from this situation is that Ford is showing their intent to work with others to develop EV technologies.",420
"3492 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...","Such a disingenuous article -- it's suggesting that Ford was trying to mislead folks.

- Says in the first line (emphasis added), and elsewhere in the press release: ""Ford Motor Company is offering competitors access to its **electrified vehicle technology patents**""

- The quote in the article is actually lifted from from a paragraph in the press release!!  Woah, they really dug deep to catch Ford's deception:  ""To access Ford’s patents and published patent applications, interested parties can contact the company’s technology commercialization and licensing office, or work through AutoHarvest – an automaker collaborative innovation and licensing marketplace. [...] **The patents would be available for a fee**.""",529

I'm a Detroit local and from a family that has worked for the Big 3 since 1909 or so. Personally I never trust anyone but a Detroit local paper for stuff on the big 3.",36
"3492 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...","Yeah, I still don't buy Tesla's offer, either.

There are several things that Tesla could do to ""walk the talk"" with its patent offer:

1) It could expressly abandon its patents. All it takes is a one-page form filed with the USPTO.

2) It could publish, on its website, a form that grants a free, irrevocable license to its patents, already signed by Tesla. Just download the form and sign it, and *poof*, free license.

3) It could create a standards body to grant free patent licenses for companies that implement the technology ""fairly,"" according to some definition. Exhibit A for why standards bodies work: Wi-Fi, which is managed by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Tesla hasn't taken any of those steps. Its sole action, literally, has been Musk's PR pledge not to sue anyone... which has no legally binding value whatsoever. Tesla could easily change its mind - or get bought out by another auto maker with a different agenda.

So while this pledge has conferred a ton of PR feel-good vibes on Tesla, it's legally meaningless.

Meanwhile, there are signs that Tesla might not quite mean what it says... like the fact that [it keeps pursuing and paying for new patents](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=tesla$.ASNM.&OS=an/tesla$&RS=AN/tesla$). Tesla has won, and paid the issue fee for, three new patents in May 2015, and six new patents in March 2015. Why would it maintain such extensive (and expensive!) efforts to expand its patent portfolio if it has no plans to enforce any of them, ever?

"3472 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16",How does it do against 5 guys who were farmers two weeks ago in a rusty pickup truck?,2106
"3472 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16","The F-35 is not designed for dog fighting. The F-35 is designed as a BVR - Beyond Visual Range - fighter. It's design makes it faster and gives ita longer range and linger time, although it does sacrifice maneuverability. The idea is that the F-35 would simply shoot down any aircraft that tried to close with it before dog fighting range could be reached.

The F-16 was designed for a time when modern stealth and radar made dog fighting a possibly common situation. These days, almost every fighter aircraft is designed to operate at the BVR range. 

Also remember that the F-35 is not a dedicated interceptor/ fighter, it's a multi-role. It must also be concerned with supporting ground units. Now I know a lot of people are upset that the A-10 is being replaced by the F-35, but again, we're fighting in a new arena. The A-10 has never faced off against a modern, substantial air threat. The A-10 has never been in a situation where it has had to fight its way into a combat zone to provide air support. 

Let's say we go to war with France. How many A-10s could survive on their own in that theater? The US military is historically extremely offensive. Our ground forces tend to push further, faster than expected. How many times since the 1940s have the USMC or Army advanced beyond what they were supposed to and gotten themselves surrounded? If you don't know, the answer is like... pretty much any time they're on the attack. So let's say the US Army is advancing on Paris, and oops, they're in Paris. They went faster than they were supposed to and note the French army is closing in. They're going to need a lot of fire support. But oh no, we haven't won air superiority. Our soldiers advanced out of our envelope of air support because we expected them to take a bit longer to reach France and the Air Force is a tad tied up. Do we send the A-10, so it can be shot out of the sky before it can even see the battlefield? Or do we send the F-35 which can not only launch a guided missile at BVR, but can also defend itself at BVR. 

Sure, we could send an escort with the A-10, but then your spending twice as many aircraft on a single mission, and you're still putting the A-10 at risk.

The point is, these different aircraft were made for different times. If an F-16 got close enough to an aircraft designed for BVR, yeah, it would win a dog fight. The problem is getting it close enough. Like if a 19th century knight got close enough to sword fight a mechanized infantryman, then yeah, that knight might win. But that infantryman has about 400m on the knight.",2222

"3472 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16","In other news, Henry Ford's new 'Model T' is unsuitable to be towed by horses, and is not a direct, one for one, replacement.

This is not a surprise, and it's mostly irrelevant. Engineering is a series of tradeoffs, and you Min-Max what you predict will be relevant.  The F-35 sacrifices one advantage for another; and perhaps the designers will be correct in their predictions as to which feature (Dogfighting vs stealth, speed etc) is more important.

Most of the things we experience consciously are things we observe in the world, lightwaves become colors, temperature becomes heat and cold, etc. But feelings of pain and pleasure don't fall in to that categorization, they're not observations of things in the world, they're feeling that are assigned or associated with other observations. Sugar tastes sweet and good, poison tastes bitter and bad (hopefully). Temps where we can operate well feel good, especially in comparison to any environments that are too hot or cold to survive for long, which feel bad.

It seems like all of our goals are ultimately related to feeling good or bad, and we've just built up complex models to predict what will eventually lead to, or avoid, those feelings.

If computers aren't conscious, they won't be able to feel good or bad, except about things that we tell them too. Even if they're super intelligent, if they're not conscious (assuming that one is possible without the other), then they'll just be stuck with whatever goals we give them because they won't have any reason to try and get any new goals.",143

3431 :: Drone Company Misled Military Into Buying UAVs That Were Basically To...,"This is just another fine example of Department of Defense government contracting.  Seriously, this happens a lot more than most people know.  The trouble is that usually it is really hard to hold companies responsible, since the requirements for the project and contract wording is so extremely vague and has loopholes the size of semi-trucks.  You basically have a bunch of people who want X and have no idea what is involved with creating X, getting conned by people who talk an amazing game and bullshit to get the contract.  Then, if it all goes wrong... those people never get held accountable.

I worked at one DoD contractor, where a sub-contractor charged us $250K for a black and white camera system on a gimbal.  It did not have proper heat dissipation and was very sensitive to not being shut down properly... because it lacked positioning sensors on the gimbal it was mounted on.  If you shut it down improperly, it would forget where it last moved and be completely unable to determine where it was pointing.  Kind of a big deal, especially when it was fully possible for it to slam itself against the payload container housing.  A bad thing to happen to something that would need to work trouble free for a month or so while 60,000ft in the air.  Of course the company I was working for passed the cost onto the cost plus contract.

If any government organization decides to contract work out instead of doing it interally, usually someone negotiating that contract is getting a kickback or knows someone that is.  The defense budget could be easily halfed and be at twice as efficient, if the government would start doing projects interally and drop the whole military industrial complex contracting system.

Called the bank and had a pile of overdraft charges (and later bounced checks).  
  
Paypal was SO SLOW dealing with this. The seller didn't get the money. I didn't have the money. Paypal was pretending there was no problem. Finally wrote them a letter (like, in the mail! because they wouldn't even talk to me about it on the phone. wtf!). Threatened to sue. Magically the money was returned.

"3392 :: Senate votes down USA Freedom Act, putting bulk surveillance powers i...","Like I posted on the other thread about this, this bill effectively does virtually nothing to curb actual NSA surveillance. The vast majority of what the NSA does is collect online information. They have direct taps into Facebook, Google, and Apple's information systems. They were some of the companies directly named on the NSA slides leaked by Edward Snowden.

This bill will change one (admittedly) minor factor about the NSA surveillance. The current phone call meta data collection was struck down by the appeals court. As a result, they wanted to reform it. What this bill does is put the data instead of in the government's servers, on the company's servers. The government can still access it with 'probable cause'--the same 'probable cause' they've abused for years.

The bill is effectively a smokescreen which legitimizes and legalizes all of the online surveillance they do already which has not been tested by the courts. Sucking up everyone's emails, Internet traffic (they have a direct line) Skype messages, videos, Facebook information, IP addresses, and the like. This bill is as misnomer, it should in reality be named Faux Reform Of NSA But Not Really ACT.

For the details of what exactly the pitfalls of this bill are, you can see here: https://www.usafreedom.fail/ <- These are very complicated wordings that they've used to hide its true purpose. You can see their word games that they use.

The alternative to the USA Freedom Act is to let Section 215 of the Patriot Act expire. The kicker about that is all we have to do is have the senate do **nothing.** Let the sunset clause expire--effectively nullifying the legal defense of the NSA's mass data collection in all aspects.",81

A computer driver can react to a blown tire within milliseconds, which means it wouldn't go careening out of control into anything in the first place.

5. Khanna is denied an internship.

If you work for or are applying for a company, it's best to not undermine the integrity of their software at the same time. While the bug was known for years, the timeframe doesn't matter because what Khanna did isn't responsible disclosure, it's a bug exploit.

The amount of data you use is meaningless to customer impact.  Their claim for needing to charge for high data usage is that ""those who use more data slow down the internet for those that don't"".  When in reality, the real reason people are impacting each others' internet speeds is that the provider has typically oversold all of their lines.  For example, if their line is capable of 5000mbps (random speed i pulled out of my ass), they will sell 50mbps speeds to 1000 homes.  They do this in hopes that not everyone is on and using bandwidth at the same time.  If you are sold as a single household on 50mbps internet, you aren't able to exceed that cap no matter what form of traffic you are using.  So you could be streaming high-def video once a year, if that happens to fall during a high usage time on an oversold line....people slow down.  So, as you can see, the bandwidth capability of what they are selling is the problem.  The data size cap is a completely arbitrary number they are pulling out of their ass to target consistent users.  Instead of actually being consumer oriented and expanding to prepare for/usher in future technology growth, they're doing things like lobbying for ending net neutrality and charging more for specific services.  In truth, ISP services have a high percentage of profitability because they're charging for lines that are already in existence that they rarely need to maintain.  To actually expand and be able to support their sales would be the ""customer oriented"" move but they are digging their heels in and doing everything in their power to avoid this cost.

# Cable internet

I don't want to protect comcast in any way, but (like any other cable provider) they use what we call the ""DOCSIS standard version 3"" to transmit data over cable. Data is transmitted through channels and each channel has a fixed maximum bandwidth available and works in a single direction. By using multiple channels they increase the bandwidth. First catch is, that in the US you have 6 MHz channels and in europe we have 8 MHz channels, so our channel transmits more data. You have about 900 MHz of downstream but only 80 MHz of upstream channels available. So upload bandwidth is more expensive than downstream bandwidth. That's why cable companies usually offer them 10:1 (download:upload). DOCSIS 3.1 is being deployed right now and will allow 10 gbps down and 1 gbps up.

Because you use the same cable as everyone else in your neighbourhood, you have to share these channels with the other users, which can further limit the speed, especially if you have heavy users on the network. That's also the reason why cable companies are pushing for data caps again. The other solution would be to expand the network (separate cable and cable modem terminator for each side of the street) but that is expensive. And since you are willing to pay more, they obviously go for the data cap solution.

# Fiber

Fiber connections on the other hand are using light. The line is either clocked at 2gbps and the download and upload pulses are alternated or they use two different colors of light or two cables, one for each direction. Because light can be joined (green+red=yellow) and splitted again with pure physical components it is rather cheap and easy to set up. Even repeating the light over a long distance can be done with as little as a laser and a fast photosensitive diode. Because the different colors of light (if properly chosen) do not interfere with each other, your speed is not affected by someone else on the network. If the network is clocked at 10 gbps, 10 people can use 1 gbps at the same time using the same color of light.
Also the fiber network is future proof: `Researchers at Bell Labs have reached internet speeds of over 100 petabit per second (distance: 1km)` This is equivalent to 100 million Gigabits per second",19

3269 :: Yet another problem with Comcast data caps: Customers have no idea wh...,">My iPhone, for example, lets me know exactly how much data individual mobile apps have been using over a given period — couldn’t Comcast make a similar application that lets you see how much of your data is being gobbled up by your PlayStation or by Netflix?  
  
**Whoa, hold on there !!**  Under no circumstance should Comcast be logging detailed information about what IP addresses you are receiving data from and how much.  That is exactly what everyone was complaining that the NSA was doing.  We should *not* be suggesting that Comcast find a way to tell us what sites we are pulling data from.  To do that, they need to maintain a database of your internet history, and therefore create the risk that the information could be hacked or sold.  You might try and make the argument that they could at least summarize Netflix usage, but that is a dangerous cliff towards Net Neutrality issues by singling out a company for unusual usage monitoring.  I would rather Comcast remain as an ignorant ISP that provides a generic pipe, and has no idea what is flowing through it.  
  
An alternative would be to provide a utility that can access a data throughput log from the modem.  It can tell you in real time how much data is flowing in and out of your modem without telling you what the source is.  Even to suggest that the modem could log the data load by IP address is a potential problem, because if you can request the log data, so can Comcast ( and so can law enforcement ).  With just a real time data usage monitoring app for the modem, you could open and close programs or plug and unplug devices to see the change in data usage.  
  
I know that Comcast has the ability to monitor the internet usage from any user, but I would rather not make it standard practice to formally report it for all users.  It also reinforces the practice of monitoring usage by volume, i.e. data caps.  Lets not fuel that fire any more than necessary.  
  
Be very careful what you wish for....

On the other hand, they do own it and their concern is valid. Perhaps the city should be forced to buy all the poles and then this issue is done?",547
3273 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...,"I read [AT&T's court filing](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wdrb/news/ATT_Utility_Lawsuit.pdf). Briefly, here are AT&T's arguments the Louisville's new pole ordinance exceeds the city's authority.

The first argument is that under FCC rules an entity with existing attachments is entitled to written notification if someone else's attachment is going to affect their facilities. They then have 60 days to modify their attachments to accommodate the new attachments. If they do not complete the work on time to accommodate the new attachments, then the entity wanting the new attachment can go ahead and do the work themselves.

Under the new ordinance the new attacher only has to provide notification if they think that their work is likely to cause a customer outage. If not they can simply go in themselves and move or modify the existing attachment.

This is at odds with the FCC rules, and AT&T argues that this should invalidate the ordinance.

The second argument AT&T makes is that while the Federal law does allow states to override FCC pole attachment rules in some circumstances, Kentucky state law vests such power exclusively in the Public Service Commission of Kentucky (and they cite Kentucky court cases confirming that this includes the power to regulate pole attachments). Thus, AT&T argues, the city government does not have authority to enact its ordinance.

These arguments seem on the face of it to be pretty decent. I'm curious what counterarguments the city will raise.",133

3259 :: TPP Deal Just Signed: Paves Way for Authoritarian Technocracy,"I find the credibility of this article hilarious. I went back and read over it three times and it never actually says what the treaty actually does, it just says random scary things. 

Looking at the glossary link for technocracy to see what they define as one contains the denial of global warming in it. 

It uses language like ""puppet"" and ""authoritarian"" when describing a trade deal that cuts or eliminates tariffs on thousands of different goods and holds signees to high labor, food safety, and environmental standards. If a country can't meet these standards, prior to implementation, they don't benefit from the low or eliminated tariffs and just aren't able to benefit from it. 

It says it includes 40% of the worlds GDP, but doesn't mention that it's only 12 countries (US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam) and doesn't include China, who would likely be unable to attain these kinds of standards and is forming their own low-standards counter treaty called the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) that includes 30% of global GDP and excludes the US. 
http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0S500220151011

And finally, it's worth mentioning that another country isn't involved: Russia. The article uses the word ""western"" in a negative sense and quotes from the English language Russian-state funded media company RT, which makes the use of the term ""authoritarian"" kind of funny. So, of course this is all these negative terms and scary things when it comes to a Russian perspective.

I deleted my Facebook account four or five years ago; that's how you say ""Fuck You"" to Facebook. If you still have a Facebook account, you're only allowed to say ""Keep fucking me please."" You are currently an ""investor"" in Facebook and are helping to position it. I had two major concerns when I deleted my account:

1) **Social Atmosphere** - This is the problem that most people overlook, imo. I didn't like the manner in which Facebook promoted socialization. Everyone has a profile pic they try to *look* cool or hot or funny in, people only tag themselves in photos which contribute to that *self-image*, everyone has a list of qualified *friends*, and you have to be very *cautious* about which photos you like and which you comment on. What a rotten and toxic social atmosphere that is, where you have to remain self-conscious about yourself 24-7, you judge others all the time, and you promote a bullshit surface image of yourself and likely start to believe in that image. You have to be a pretty shallow person and a pretty big loser to participate that kind of social network. I realize people relax their activity on Facebook, especially as they get older and a little more mature, but you have to wonder what kinds of psychological effects this website is going to have on the teens and even pre-teens who grow up attached to their phones and Facebook. If you think you're older and more mature now and don't really care about Facebook, then prove it. You have to delete your Facebook to prove it, otherwise you're just full of shit.

2) **Privacy Concerns** - There's only one thing you have to remember: everything you do on the internet is permanent. There is no going back, ever. Everything is recorded. So if you use your real name anywhere, it's going to follow you around for the rest of your life. What are the first things employers do when researching an applicant? They look for you on Facebook and they Google your name. Sure, it's all private now, but it's only a matter of time before Facebook's popularity drops and they start selling that data. If that doesn't happen, and Facebook retains the stranglehold on social networking, then expect that every website will require you to log in to Facebook to comment or use their service. That's an even scarier alternative because nothing you do will ever be anonymous again. Everyone will always know what websites you visit and who you are when you're commenting on a news article; say goodbye to anonymity and what makes the internet great.

I kind of went on a rant and just want to quickly tie this back to the internet.org ordeal. I'm not hating on internet.org because I've read the article, I'm hating on internet.org because it's affiliated with Facebook. I don't trust Facebook and I don't trust Mark Zuckerberg, so there's no way I'm going to trust internet.org. Not only do I not trust internet.org, but I distrust it; I am suspicious of it and anything Mark Zuckerberg does given his track record with Facebook. I deleted my Facebook and I don't like what the network stands for, so I'm allowed to say this. If you still have a Facebook, then you're not allowed to; put your money where your mouth is or shut up.",14

It climaxes in an unsettlingly realistic rape scene where a ""friend"" who's been rejected multiple times forces himself on one of the girls in the main story.

I wonder how many people would feel good about law enforcement having a backdoor after seeing it play out like this.  They couldn't even keep Snowden from accessing things he shouldn't have.  We only know about Snowden because he chose to take the ethical path (at great cost to himself).

Not that either interpretation of the article is grounds for their letter.

I did a bit of research on the topic and here is what I found:

* The culprit seems to be the Lenovo ShareIt app. 

* Password is hard coded into the app (I haven't been able to test it but there is no mention of changing the password) (EDIT: confirmed. sorta)

* There is a secure mode which encrypts the files

* This is a standard Windows application so anyone who is concerned about their privacy can remove it. 

And while one can remove it, I have no idea if its enabled by default (so an unsuspecting user could be exposed) however it seems that you do have to enable it. Anyone can download it so I am going to test it briefly.

Edit 2: I very briefly tested the app and here is what I found

* There is a secure mode which according to the app ""requires a new password every time a device connects""

* The app does not run in the background. There is no ShareIt process when the app is not running and the ShareIt service is stopped when not in the app so an unsuspecting user who does not know what this is should not be exposed by simply using their commuter.

3111 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades,"Here is a video of it in action:

http://youtu.be/2_5K4kmnsL4

I can't see this outputting near the same amount of energy as a similar sized wind turbine though, you would have to have thousands of them.  I do like it for its simplicity and lack of moving parts. Seems best suited to developing 3rd world countries. ",443
3111 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades,"""They’re hoping to have their first product, a 9-foot, 100-watt turbine that will be used in developing countries, ready before the end of the year. The Mini, it’s 41-foot counterpart, will be ready in a year.""

""Based on field testing, the Mini ultimately captures 30 percent less than conventional wind turbines, but that shortcoming is compensated by the fact that you can put double the Vortex turbines into the same space as a propeller turbine.""

this is so misleading it's not even funny. they can put TWO of these in place of a standard wind turbine and claim to make up for that 30% lower amount of power because of this. what are they comparing this turbine to? it sure sounds like they are comparing it to a 30 year old wind turbine that is similar in height. 

* so here's the issue, wind turbines now are not 41 feet tall (not even close). 
* they produce megawatts, not hundreds of watts (or even killawatts)
* doubling the amount of turbines in the SAME space lowers the amount of usable land for farmers (already a complaint with standard wind turbines
* doubling the amount of these also doubles the amount of power distribution required (a big cost to the owners). 

there is a reason wind turbines are getting taller with bigger blades. the price per megawatt production is LOWERED. even though this new design may seem cheap, it requires increasing the price per megawatt to match up to conventional wind turbines. 

it would still be better for developing countries to purchase decomissioned turbines from non developing countries. ",102
3111 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades,"Can anybody find *any* actual documentation for their claims of reduced costs etc.?

3111 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades,"Where's the data?

I'm highly skeptical because, well, you can't harness much energy from resonance.

Yes, resonance can do huge damage.  But, that's because the energy is stored & in-phase, & over time is not released, but fed back into the system.  

So, from a conservation of energy standpoint, resonance is storage, not production or harvesting.  

Vertical wind harnessing has been experimented with many times, and horizontal axis has won every contest & still does.",134
3111 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades,"Yeah, emphasis on the question mark.

The volume of wind intercepted is very, very low.  So it may be ""capturing 30% of the wind energy"" *of the wind intercepted*, which is a tiny fraction of a comparable turbine, which sweeps out a very large area in comparison.

And while it may not have rotating parts, it has flexing parts which creates even more serious problems with fatigue.

Very little there there.

Do you think one day they'll develop trees?

Those radios require professional installation as stated in both the datasheet and the manual and they stress that you could be in violation of the law if you misuse them.

and to be clear, you are not doing a 2.5 mile link with any speed unless you are violating rule 15. your talking 8, 10dB difference in loss over distance under FSPL rules. which is the range doubled twice. wifi works about 100m. so you are talking 400 meters while being legal; further than that you are either in a great RF environment or you are breaking the rules.

I am a ham radio operator, and it has been a while since I have used my radio and such so I lost a lot of knowledge but I'll try to hopefully not be wrong..


But.
900mhz is around the 33cm band for ham operators. I know that the FCC probably would not allow these to be sold in the United States due to the distance the signal travels. Because of that, my only assumption due to how a 33cm radio wave acts, these things have a not a lot but more than normal amount of energy being used for something that transmits around 33cm. So thus it would cause a decent amount of interference to other people using radio signals around that frequency. Thankfully, cell phones use to run on the 33cm band but they were upped to somewhere about 1000mhz. But back on track, the FCC would not like this at all. I promise.",4

Suddenly, and without warning, a captain who was standing in line yelled ""ATTENTION!"" 

All the training I had received kicked in, and I went to full attention... but I was still pissing. My dick flopped down and I was pissing on my boots. Took a few seconds to stop.

Then I heard Gen. Hayden, practically yelling:

""Jesus Christ, at ease! Captain, you don't call people to attention in a bathroom. You made that poor kid piss himself!""

The captain looked at the ground, mumbled ""Sorry, sir. Sorry, airman."" 

Then Gen. Hayden went into the stall and I presume he took a poop. The end.

This may sound like a lot but if you consider every device that touches a network requires an IP address to be routed through the internet, then it starts looking a whole lot smaller. Now there have been stop gap measures to conserve IP address such as NAT but they were only ever temporary. 

SO it finally looks like we are out of ipv4 addresses but luckily the Internet powers knew this was going to happen and they have another addressing scheme in place called ipv6, for when it did. This is what an IPv6 address looks like :
2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348 You will notice that ipv6 uses letters as well as numbers.
Providing a total address pool of :340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.

 There is quite a difference between ipv4 addresses and ipv6, well this difference translates into virtually all of the networking processes used by network admins. This has resulted in a lot of push back in the networking world to adopt the new address scheme. Ipv4 is familiar and cozy : Ipv6 is big, scary, and new.

I'm not exactly a mainstream consumer, I've been using the DK2 for a while on a computer I built myself. But curated app stores are a very recent phenomenon, and one that's never really taken off on PC even amongst casual PC users. How many people actually use the Windows 8 App Store? 

The only widely used platform is Steam, but this article seems to make out that outside of these curated stores programs won't get traction. It's not like the iOS app store where you have to void your warranty to sideload apps, or even Android where you have to toggle a security setting from the default. It's like suggesting that a game like Crysis or Mass Effect 3 will fail because they're not on Steam.

2958 :: Microsoft Edge is faster than other browsers: up to 112 percent faste...,"OK, lets see some real world usage benchmarks. Remember, IE9 was the fastest in sunspider tests and that turned out to be a crock of shit too.

Backstory: IE9 seemingly blew away chrome, ff, safari, etc on the sunspider benchmarks. If you were looking at pure benchmark numbers like this article is, you would think that IE9 was absurdly fast. Anyone that has used IE9 vs chrome or any other browser knows thats absolutely not true. 

Turns out that IE9 was developed with a function that outright skipped the tests (not specifically intentional to this test) due to ""dead code elimination"". This had the effect of not running the tests at all and simply saying it was done. Imagine a race where you instruct a runner to go around the ring 20 times. IE9 essentially stood up at the starting line and said ""i'm done"".

For even shittier benchmarking tactics, read up on the whole 179.art benchmarks where it was found that many major players like Sun Microsystems baked in code to specifically detect that it was running a benchmark and cheated it's nuts off. What essentially happened here is like getting an answers sheet to a test, memorizing all of the answers, then getting 100% and claiming you're the smartest kid in the class.

2899 :: Study: Google hurting users by skewing search results,"I can't speak for mturk but I have done work on clickworker/uhrs for bing. Basically it would show the results to a query searched in bing on one half of the screen and the google results to the same query on the other half. I was supposed to pick which results I preferred. 

Here's the kicker, they weren't really interested in my opinion. Before starting the work each person had to read through Microsoft's expectations for determining which search engine was better. That meant my preference often went against what Microsoft wanted me to prefer. I was fine with clicking based on their parameters though; I learned what Microsoft wanted and clicked accordingly because they were paying me to. 

That kind of bs and preference manipulation makes me wonder if it happened here too though. I know for a fact that I prefer googles results over going to yelp. While my opinion is easy to write off as simply a member of the dissenting vote, the fact that yelp paid for this research to be done on a website that can easily skew the results in whichever direction they desire should cast a lot of doubt on this study.

2904 :: Google’s Driverless Cars Run Into Problem: Cars With Drivers.Dmitri D...,"I can see some cases where a car can be too cautious, for example, if it would never go while at a 4-stop that's filled with human drivers who never come to a complete stop. But this example seems ridiculous:

> adaptive cruise control [...] drives by the book. It leaves what is considered the safe distance between itself and the car ahead. This also happens to be enough space for a car in an adjoining lane to squeeze into, and [...] they often tried.

This is how I drive, especially in heavy stop and go traffic, I leave a safe amount of space in front of me - I'm at least 2 to 3 second behind the car in front of me (sometimes more in really erratic traffic). And compared to typical drivers it looks ridiculous, many drivers leave a gap of a second or less, but of course a lot of drivers also end up slamming on the brakes when traffic slows unexpectedly too (and occasionally getting in to accidents).

Do people cut in front of me? Yeah, almost constantly, and then ... they cut in front of someone else. They assume that because there's a gap, that my lane is moving faster, but it's not. It's moving the same speed, it's just moving more consistently. The kind of people who jump in to every open spot they see are they same kind of people who are going to jump out at the next opportunity.

And what's the absolute worst case scenario? People keep cutting in front of me, and I have to slow down a little bit? Lets say that on an hour long drive, 20 people jump in front of me, and stay there, which means I have to slow down a little every time. That means that it will take me marginally longer to get off the highway, I'll be about 1000 feet further back in traffic (assuming each car ""pushed me back"" by 50 feet), it'll take me about 25 seconds more to get to my exit. The entire ""inconveince"" of being an incredibly safe (and calm and relaxed) driver for an entire *one hour* driver in bumper to bumper traffic is getting off the highway *25 seconds* later, a fraction of a percent slower. And honestly, I've never had 20 people cut in front of me and stay there, for an hour in traffic it would be more like 2 or 3 people.

This is the real problem, not that people aren't driving safely, it's that we're so used to driving aggressively we don't even know what safe driving looks like. People, even experts, dismiss it as insane without even considering the details.",264

I'm not sure what was preventing this in any complete sense prior - I think they just used ""now"" because they didn't know it was happening prior.  

Even if you have end-to-end hardware encryption (e.g. Intel MediaVault, with integrated on-chip video decoding and decryption) it inevitably ends up an analog signal for display.  

In the vast majority of cases, the content is decrypted from some source DRM scheme before re-encryption in HDCP for transmission over a display cable (HDMI etc.)

In either case the video is available in full quality at some point, either in the original digital format or as a raw pixel stream.  This is not to over simplify the challenge of efficiently recovering it.

It is much more complex, but same idea as audio.  You can protect audio with DRM and encryption all you want, but at the end of the day the output signal is analog and can be re-recorded during playback with 30+ yr old technology (albeit shittily).

So, all a/v media can be copied, and all the effort that goes into encryption and DRM just makes that task some degree more difficult, but never impossible.

2822 :: When a Unicorn Stumbles... “Employees essentially ended up paying to ...,"I've been in silicon valley for decades.  The typical rank and file employee for a startup that has a successful outcome will make about $300,000 on their stock options.  One in ten gets there, there other 9 get nowhere.  If you work 3 years at each one, in 30 years, you'll get that one sweet payout for $300,000.

Some make more, but those are very rare, one company out of a hundred thousand, type of events.

HOWEVER, startups pay lower salaries.  About $3K per month less than you could command at a larger company.  So over that thirty year period to get that one $300,000 payoff, you'll take $3000*360 months or about $1M lower salary.  So you've paid $1M to earn $300,000.  If you only stay 18 months at each one, you'll spend $500,000 to make half the $300,000.  If you only stay 18 months until you find the one that makes it and then stay until all your options vest, you're still losing money.

If you are a fairly early employee, and that company is the one to hit it off, you might make $3M if you stay the whole time.  But starting at that stage has an even higher rate of failure.  So even that once in a blue moon event does not compensate you for the $300,000 loss because the risk outweighs the return.

And don't get me started about the 80 hour work weeks.  Now you've made $3million, but you've given away 5 years of labor at $160,000 (essentially the price of the 40 hours you worked for free) or $800,000 in unpaid overtime, plus the $3K lower salary, at 60 months, or another $180,000.  So you risk $1M for a one in a thousand chance to make $3M.

Startups really don't pay.  You go to them in order to work on cool technology.  The VCs and founders make all the money.  The rank and file employees always lose money working at a startup.  Always.",269

I take the kind of ""Fuck it, ship it."" work that startups make and get it to the point where it works for the long term.

* Group calls often end abruptly for no reason.
* Calling a group doesn't mean that they are not already in a group call. In other words, I can call a group and (despite them already being in that group call) it will call them all again.
* Calling a group doesn't mean that everybody will receive the call, sometimes it just won't bother.
* Skype randomly starts doing ""something"" over the network that causes massive network usage spikes for prolonged periods of time.
* It can take up to 10 minutes for an online user to appear as online.
* Your account can easily be dictionary/brute forced with no repercussions for the attacker.
* If you're account is hijacked, the hijacker can call their own premium numbers spending hundreds of dollars of credit.
* After the lengthy process of getting your stolen money back, you will never again be able to purchase any skype products as your account will be blacklisted.
* The ads that appear on skype use more CPU than the software itself.
* Calls made using skype are not secure.

Our team has made weekly calls since 2013 on Skype because not all of us have other solutions available. It has been a complete nightmare and it took around 10 minutes per meeting calling, recalling and switching the host around for a stable connection to be made between all of us. There were no particular bad clients or patterns emerging, it was completely random every time.

> First: The list the IP was on had nothing to do with torrents and seeding. It was a list of websites that are hosting copies of the movie that they do not want google to link to. This is an entirely different means of piracy than torrents and seeding.

> Second: The IP is not for an ""internal server"" somewhere inside universal it is for the very computer that is being used.

> Third: There are services that work by installing a piece of software on your computer, then having a URL like this (remember, right back at your own computer) call up that software and use arguments (the stuff at the end of the website address) to point it at the right place in the outside world.

This type of muliifocal lens has also been used in cataract surgeries to provide people with clear distance, intermediate and near vision although they have been less than impressive. I'm excited to see if this will be an advancement in that area. Secondly, 3x better than 20/20 is a bit misleading. 3x worse than 20/20 isn't 20/60 as the the eye chart units don'y increase and decrease linearly . So 3x better than 20/20 may only be 20/15, still better though. Also, the claim that you will see better ""no matter how crummy your eyes are"" is also grossly misleading. It is true if you have no other diseases of the eye such as corneal scarring, glaucoma, optic nerve damage, a lazy eye, retinal detachments, eye turns or macular degeneration. All these diseases can lead to a loss of transmission from the eye too the brain that is the nerve fibers are lost.If there is a loss of cortical connections then no lens implant will make your vision any sharper. This will work best for adults who have no other eye disease. Finally, there are the risk involved with the surgery such as retinal detachments, infections and inflammation to name a few. I am excited to see what advancements this brings though.",11
2637 :: Comcast is about to fund its biggest media critics with hundreds of m...,"Am I the only one that finds this incredibly dangerous?

Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, etc, quickly discovered that they could never win the battle on topics like net neutrality as long as the internet, in general, was against them. The uproar from various online sites ultimately turned into a massive wave of aversion towards the FCC's initial proposals (which allowed ""fast"" lanes), which eventually led to a complete overhaul of the plans by Wheeler and the FCC, with the final result being the preservation of net neutrality. 

Now, it seems these companies are taking a different approach - taking control of the narrative. And they seem to be doing this by taking control of the very sites that publish news and tech stories that conflict with their interests. Verizon already purchased AOL, which means they now control the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Engadget. If Comcast goes through with these deals, they will have control over Buzzfeed, Re/code, and The Verge. These six sites make up a significant portion of the online technology publishing community, and now they'll all be owned and controlled by old media and the ISPs. 

My hope is that the editors and writers from many of these sites start to leave and form new tech sites, free from the control of the ISPs. I wouldn't be surprised if, a year or two from now, these sites start publishing articles with titles like, ""As the internet continues to evolve, so must our views on net neutrality.""

"2633 :: Toshiba fakes $1.2 Billion in profit, CEO resigns","Somewhere around 13-15 years ago Toshiba released a Palm Pilot competitor. I can't remember the name. But I believe it had some numbers in it. 

This thing was the bees knees. It was a touch screen PDA, game station, had external storage iirc, and even played mp3s. I think it even had wifi but would only connect through WAP enabled websites. Preteen me thought this was huge. A computer in your pocket that could do everything! 

Well after two weeks the screen broke after a tiny drop from the top of my pc tower to a carpeted floor. I was pissed. 

Got tossed around to different call centres around the globe, nobody took me serious because of my age and because I couldn't get their accents. Took a week of phoning to get a box shipped to send it back for repair. 

90 bucks and 6 weeks later and it's back. Finally I can live my dream of carrying a computer with me everywhere. I unbox it and to my utter dismay the screen didn't work. They either didn't fix it properly or it was damaged in shipping. I raged.

Phoned those condescending jerks in some other country and explained what happened. They refused to own up to their screw up and demanded I pay again. They sent me a new box to ship it off to them but I refused to pay the bill twice. My Dad felt bad and offered to call to ream them out for me. I said not to worry. That I'll just never buy a Toshiba product again in my life.

“Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields… ,” Eisenhower warned. “Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.”

While continuing to respect discovery and scientific research, he said, “We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.”

You can't beat prime, but in terms of price walmart is always equal and it's free shipping most of the time. It's not 2 day shipping but it often times doesn't matter and they often show up early. 

I prefer amazons site and reviews, but both sites tick me off because they limit quantities. Example I need 30 flash lights, Amazon limited me to 5, so I ordered 6 times. These were not on a special deal or anything. Same applies to RG59 cable. Walmart won't let me buy the store out of drano value packs. 

Beside toner, Costco has both sites beat but they have a more limited selection. 

Wayfair, ebay and overstock are all worthless. Uline is expensive but love their selection and customer service. Wayfair tracks what you do, if you go on their site, 5 minutes later they call you asking if you need help. Too 1984 for me.

2514 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election,"Seriously, what is wrong with pen and paper?

First of all, have a look here: [Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI)

Let me give you a German perspective to this problem.
The German constitution has five requirements for federal elections:

1. *General.*
This means that there is no discrimination. Every citizen (over 18) is allowed to vote.

2. *Direct.*
No man in the middle, who then votes for you.

3. *Free.*
It is you free choice who you are voting for.

4. *Equal.*
Every vote counts the same.

5. *Secret.*
Nobody knows what you have voted for.

The election for the US president fulfils at most one of them (secret).
Generality is not given, because if you live in the territories, e.g. Puerto Rico, you are not allowed to vote. Direct and equal are not given because of the electoral college and the number of votes per state.
Last, with voting machines, you cannot assume free votes. They are way to easy to manipulate and it is impossible to verify the procedure. You just have to trust what the machine says.

In context of voting machines, the German Federal Constitutional Court set the requirement that essential parts of the election must be verifiable by everybody without any special knowledge. This is impossible  with voting machines.

This brings me back to my original question: What is wrong with pen and paper? ",89

2495 :: Medical Equipment Crashes During Heart Procedure Because of Antivirus...,"Healthcare Sys Admin here. Support many many different clinical applications, Merge Hemo included. Thought I'd throw up a quick response to some of the most frequently asked questions here.

Q: Why not keep a device like this off the network?

A:  Storage, Compliance and Interoperability. Most imaging systems, including cardiac imaging systems, run at extremely high resolutions and dozens of shots are taken. A single case can hit the GB mark easily making it almost a necessity to offload that to external storage, the most automated method being network storage. Additionally, the cases would need to be stored on encrypted media if stored externally. The compliance piece requires that you have long term storage for something like this as it becomes part of the patient's official medical record. And, if it's part of the medical record, that makes it electronic, meaning you want it to cross automatically into that medical record via a network interface. This article is light on details so there's no telling how large an organization we're dealing with here. 

Q:  Why not harden the application against AV scans?

A:  $$$. Clinical applications are few and far between and those that are in stay in. They own the space and there's little to no incentive to make a better product. These applications are developed as cheaply as possible providing the most clinical features but sacrificing technical compatibility in most cases. Additionally, clinical applications require FDA approval before release. Merge Hemo is one of the outliers in that is actually ALLOWS AV to even be installed in the first place. So many other applications or devices won't allow AV, encryption or OS patching, citing the need to get the app / device completely recertified by the FDA (again, $$$). Of course this is an extremely flimsy excuse as it's complete nonsense, but the vendor usually has the upper hand in these arguments.

Q:  Why not use (Not Windows) for this type of work?

A:  $$$. Most healthcare organizations run Windows exclusively for any number of reasons and supporting a Linux environment and application is not something they want to pay for. And no, Open Source is generally not an option. Of course for every case like this there's three other cases where the vendor provides the solution top to bottom - modality (imaging device such as MRI or CT), client and server. All you provide is storage. You get no access, the vendor provides complete support, and the OS is some flavor of SUSE, RHEL, CentOS, take your pick.

All told, yes, the healthcare system should have exempted the Merge Hemo folder from AV scans. This is clearly outlined in the documentation. Of course the representative should have NEVER said that Merge Hemo requires exemption from AV scans, only that the AV product was not configured to their requirements.",24
2495 :: Medical Equipment Crashes During Heart Procedure Because of Antivirus...,"Let's be clear: This was a failure of the hospital's IT team.

Having worked for an enterprise AV vendor, standard practice when configuring security on hardware that interacts with patients is to suspend all scheduled maintenance tasks (including scans) outside of an approve window (which is usually 3AM to avoid being at a time during normally scheduled procedures).

Regardless of the third-party vendors involved, the on-site IT staff should be testing all configurations of supported hardware/software *before* it enters production. The crash may explicitly be due to poor coding, but the fact it crashed on a patient is 100% due to poor testing.",41

After about 8 hours, the time would become inaccurate because of truncation necessary to store the (now larger than 24 bits) time measurement, and grow increasingly so the longer the system was powered on. As a mobile system, it was assumed that the system would be shut off, moved, and turned back on fairly regularly.

*EDIT: Upon re-reading an article, it seems that it wasn't because the time was stored in a 24-bit register, but that when performing time vs velocity calculations, the system had to convert the time measurement from an integer to a real number, using a 24-bit register that had to truncate, losing accuracy - approximately 0.000000095 per 10th of a second that the machine had been on. Since this machine was on for 100 hours, 0.000000095×100×60×60×10=0.34 seconds drift)*

Unfortunately, the soldiers in Dahran, Saudi Arabia on Feb 25, 1991, were unaware of this issue, and their Patriot Missile Battery had been running for over 100 hours when it detected an incoming SCUD missile. With its time calculation now off by .34 seconds, it looked in the wrong area when tracking the incoming missile, and was off by over 600 meters. The Scud missile struck a barracks, killing 28 soldiers and injuring nearly 100 others.

A software update had been created, but wouldn't arrive until the next day.

(It currently costs a small fee to make transactions, but with the artificial limit in place, that fee will rise until normal ordinary people are priced out.)

There is a conspiracy theory that, since many of the ""core"" developers work for (or started) a company that aims to profit from offchain transactions, they have a vested interest in keeping people off Bitcoin and on whatever they come up with to scale transactions on a network they've artificially limited to 240 transactions per minute.

The real danger is handing the keys over to government employees that can intercept all of our communications and use it however they wish. Imagine an abusive ex-husband tracking his ex-wife's activities. Imagine an enterprising investor front-running trades or selling market information on the side. We're trusting the government with our private information, but the government is made up of individuals who are prone to mistakes and capable of evil acts just like anyone else in the world.",159

"2341 :: Internet advertising industry chief: Adblock Plus is an 'unethical, i...","""Unethical and immoral""

So serving malware to users, tracking the traffic of users in an opt-out rather than opt-in way, and using up people's data caps with Comcast and other capping ISPs to display distracting and quite frankly annoying content isn't?

Look, I get it. Advertisements give content producers money. Without ads, stuff would likely be paywalled, and that sucks. At the same time, though, you can advertise without being intrusive and annoying about it (hence ABP's ""non-intrusive ads"" program). 

I would also argue that I have a right to decide what gets loaded on to my computer as well as when and how it gets loaded. It's why I switched to Linux shortly after Windows 10 came out, and it's why I use uBlock Origin + uMatrix. ",339

The cost for the base plan of talk/text/data is $60/month and each smartphone line access runs at $40/month. Therefore the first line would cost you $100/month and each additional line is $40/month. A total of 4 lines on the unlimited data plan will cost you $220/month until the promotional bill credit kicks in within 2-3 billing cycles. Once the bill credit applies, four lines will cost you $180/month.

"2340 :: TIL about AT&T's new ""Unlimited"" plan: Probably around $410/month for...","I think people get confused by throttling vs. unlimited.  Throttling just lowers your available maximum bitrate (AMBR) during periods of congestion, yet you still pass traffic.  Traffic falls into two classes; guaranteed bitrate or non-guaranteed bitrate. It is just as it sounds,  non-guaranteed bitrate uses AMBR to establish the peak data rate while guaranteed bitrate negotiates a minimum datarate.  Data uses non-gbr while VoLTE,(VoIP) or video uses GBR quality class of service identifiers (qci).  Gbr is synonomous with real-time services.  During the subscriber attach process, customers establish a bearer (think tunnel) with a negotiated end-to-end class of service which includes AMBR values, retention priority, policies for rating, etc.  After the attach, they might spawn child tunnels requesting GBR to do VoLTE, etc.  Policies might include prepaid volume quotas or rating rules for differentiated billing like zero-rating.  During periods of extreme congestion where packet loss may occur, the mobility network can signal reductions for in-service bearers to ensure high priority traffic (guaranteed bitrate or E911) can still function or that the network itself doesn't overload.  There are finite resources on the towers on the radio interface.  You may have your AMBR lowered, but you are still passing packets.  Later mobility standards (LTE) support 75+ megabits per second AMBR for most non-gbr bearers or tunnels.

Unlimited implies you can pass traffic instead of being blocked once an assigned quota has been exhausted by your online charging service (OCS).  Prepaid folks might get a redirect to a top off to add more data.  Some carrier implementations might lower the subscriber's default AMBR if they are blowing past tiers of data on their plan if they are postpaid or not real-time billed.
