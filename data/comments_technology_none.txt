Pretty sad.  Chattanooga is such an amazing example of what could be possible with public, city run gigabit internet, but Nashville controls the legislature and thus keeps the rest of the state in the dark ages.  As a former Memphian I'm offended but not surprised.

I remember a story about Ed Koch and the rejuvenation of New York. Apparently they had a problem with abandoned cars rotting on the street as thieves slowly stripped them. Koch wanted them all towed because they were ugly and took up valuable space. He told the parking authority that there was one car he went past every day he wanted towed -- but, he didn't say where it was because he wanted all the junk cars towed, not just the one that was an eyesore to him.

My speed went from 60mb to 6mb.  I chatted.  He/she explained that my sb6121 is end of life, so they are intentionally throttling my speed, didn't bother to tell me, and it's entirely up to me if i want to replace my current docsys3 modem with a newer docsys3 model for $100 and receive the speed I'm paying for.  But, in the meantime, they'll do something to get my speed back to 60mb, which they did.

I did this for my parents...  Their house is far back from the street.  Their internet wouldn't slow down -- it'd cut out entirely.  These interruptions would typically last anywhere from 1 to 30 minutes, so it'd be back up by the time they actually got through to somebody on the phone.  The person on the phone would be completely dismissive.  So I wrote something to do a simple ping test to the first hop beyond their router every 15 seconds or so, graph it, and make a list of these outages.  Downtime was between 10% and 25% from day to day.  

When they had a 5 page list of outages in the last few days, requesting a refund since their service was virtually unusable, that got Comcast to send a tech.  They replaced the cable from the street.  

But goddamn, it still makes me mad that I had to prove to them that their shit was broken, rather than them monitoring their own shit.

**EDIT**: I'm now back home from work, and I will be reading all comments in this thread to answer any questions that have been asked. Also, to the kind individual that gifted me gold, I really appreciate it. Thank you!


Hello, u/AlekseyP . I am a field technician working for Comcast. I wanted to make a few suggestions.

First off, I doubt that any of your equipment itself is the problem, especially if you're savvy enough to set something like this up. In that case, there are a few things that could be the problem.

First off, and most likely, is a line problem in the drop or in the house. Typically, this sort of issue would be because of what we call "ingress", which means that outside RF is somehow getting into our cable system and feeding back on the same frequencies we use for upstream (aka, the frequencies that the modem uses to talk to the CMTS). This interference would most certainly affect your speeds, as the modem would have a much harder time effectively communicating with the headend. 

Right along the same lines, if there is a kink or a nick in the cable, or a loose fitting, or just cheap cable, it could also cause an impedance mismatch in the cable. Our plant is built around a 75 Ohms resistance. When a part of the cable experiences a higher resistance, it cause the RF signal to bounce around inside the cable, which causes distortion of the signal. However, this would be a **constant** issue, rather than being intermittent.

Another possibility would be that there is a signal level issue. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as having a long drop without the benefit of RG11, or because of an issue at the tap, or because of having too many outlets in the house without having an amp. Signal levels fluctuate quite a bit between lower and higher temperatures, and if there is water in either the tap or the drop, then moisture would also cause quite a variation in signal level, which could account for the intermittent nature of the issue you're having.

Lastly, having the correct modem is going to make a big difference. If you are using an Xfinity provided modem, please look at the lights on the front to determine what kind of modem you have. If your modem has 2 wifi lights, then you have the correct equipment. If it only has 1 wifi light, then you need to call up and get an XB3 sent to your home. The difference is in the number of docsis channels that your modem can lock onto. The modem with 1 wifi light can only lock onto 8 docsis channels at a time, which limits its speeds. I've only ever seen these modems get up to a maximum of ~90mbps. The modem with 2 wifi lights, the XB3, can lock on to a maximum of 24 docsis channels, and can easily support 150+mbps. 

If, however, you have your own modem, that you purchased, I would recommend looking online to determine the maximum amount of docsis channels it can lock onto. You should have a modem that can lock on to at least 16 channels if you want to take full advantage of your speeds.

The issue you describe sounds like one of two issues to me. If I were to have an appt for a trouble call for your issue, the first thing I would check would be to see if you have the best modem for your speeds. Assuming you do, the next thing I would do would be to go out to the tap, disconnect your drop, and test for ingress at that point, and I bet that's exactly what it would be.

Ingress is very interesting. It can be caused by a number of things, whether it be a loose fitting, a nick in the cable, or just old, cheap or corroded cable. Quality cable that is properly prepped and fitted is made **specifically** to keep outside RF out, and inside RF in, and it does this with it's shielding. We use high quality tri-shield cable, with compression style F-connectors. As the cable ages, as it takes a beating from the elements, the effectiveness of the shielding is compromised. At that point, outside RF is able to leak in, causing issues. Outside RF is generated by things like cell phones, FM and AM radio, CB radio, and even electromagnetic hum from things like power lines and power tools.

Please let me know what happens. I really do care, and I'll be happy to help you however I can.

Lastly, if you want to PM me and provide me with an email address I can contact you at, or even a phone number, I will be able to speak more directly with you, and really work on getting you a solution.

Not so much shut down, but twitter suspended their API access. They could presumably just start data scraping and achieve the same results.

I'm not one of those citizens that thinks politicians should be under the microscope but I don't think twitter should be protecting a specific group of its users. Everybody is vulnerable to not being forgotten on the internet. Unless Twitter as a whole decides to completely block API access to everyone, not just political groups, they should stay out of "protecting their users". Why should politicians be protected when sports star, CEOs, and celebrities are not?

The TOS explicitly states you cannot publish deleted tweets, and that you have to monitor and retrospectively delete tweets, if the author deletes them.

Could you circumvent this by retweeting the tweet, and publishing the retweet instead of the source tweet? It's obviously too late for the deleted tweets, but would be possible for future tweets.

36
9459 :: Twitter shuts down 30 sites dedicated to saving politicians' deleted ...
When did it become fashionable to routinely replace facts with breathless hyperbole? The only way Twitter could 'shut down' any site other than its own would be if a) it was a client site (operating *entirely* under Twitter, or b) through legal action. Common sense is enough to know that neither condition would apply here, so how were these sites 'shut down'?

Well, they *weren't* 'shut down', of course. They're still there, and you can go look at them right now. What happened is that Twitter shut off access to the proprietary Twitter API that supplied their automated feeds. So now, anyone who wants to archive this stuff needs to work up their own API, or do it it manually. But the sites were not 'shut down' and Twitter has no power to do that.

Anyone who reads the article would know this, however, but all know that many people don't. Clickbait headlines win precious pageviews (not to mention delicious, delicious karma), but this is how bullshit rumours get started, and one reason why we have an online world full of witless people repeating wrong things they saw in passing somewhere. And Ceiling Cat help us, some of those people vote.

What bothers me is the german case.

The German gouvernement does not have authority to block websites. What they can do is shut down servers (if they are hosted inside Germany), if something illegal is hosted on said server, after a court decided that they should.

There is no such thing as blocking websites in German law. There was a push to do so (Law to preent access to Child Pornography), but the draft for a law got shut down because it did not make any sense whatsoever and eventually violated the constitution. ([1](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/family-minister-vs-freedom-of-speech-anti-child-pornography-law-flounders-a-627447.html) [2](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-law-that-nobody-wanted-new-internet-legislation-embarrasses-german-government-a-678782.html) [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugangserschwerungsgesetz))

So what probably happened: Some german authority (could be a local criminal police unit) contacted reddit (a company they have no authority over because it is not acting in their legal space) asked reddit to shut this particular subreddit "content" down. And reddit voluntarily did it to prevent further investigation. If they wanted, reddit could easily deny this request, because there is no legal basis for this. They could easily bring this to a german court, where freedom of press and information is regarded as an extremely high valued right.

Reddit needs to make up their minds if they want to be part of and fight for an information revolution, or a commercial link aggregation website that bends down as soon as there is the slightest trouble ahead. I am sure a company like Twitter (who have the idea of free information in their DNA) would have challenged this on a different level.

Thanks, it is awesome to see this posted, and the verbiage used is pretty important, I especially lik the part where they NOW say it is no longer about congestion management, which was the de-facto reason they originally did this. Now it is fairness, you know you paying more is more fair to them.

So, do I get $10/month credited back for every 50GB I go under the cap?

9291 :: Leak of Comcast documents detailing the coming data caps and what you...
10 years ago, when these companies disclosed their cost per gigabyte, it was 1 penny ($0.01 USD).  Today, it is far less, because of economies of scale and deals between providers at all levels.

But let's use that number as a worst case scenario.

>After reaching the 300 GB cap of "unlimited data" you will be charged $10 for every extra 50 GB.

So, that 300 GB of data costs Comcast 300 pennies, or $3.  For which you pay anywhere from $50-100 for.  Even accounting for customer service, equipment (that taxpayers paid for, ahem), etc. that still represents an insane markup no matter how you look at it.

But this is a better gauge.

That extra 50 gb costs them 50 cents, or $0.50. For which you pay them $10.  It's the same infrastructure/hardware, customer service, etc.  They don't give you anything more.  Don't change anything at their end.  Nothing at all changes whatsoever for delivering you 300 GB or 350 GB.

**Therefore, that 50 GB is sold to you at a 2,000% (aka 20x) markup at a minimum.**

The truth is that the spend probably 1/10th of that now, compared to a decade ago.

tl;dr - FUCK COMCAST.  

[edit - Some kind souls gilded me!  Thank you so very, very, very much.  :)  :)  ]
3396
9291 :: Leak of Comcast documents detailing the coming data caps and what you...
So let me get this right.

Their talking points specifically say "This is not a data cap and we do not limit a customer's use of the Internet in any way above 300 GB".  

But they have a program called the "Unlimited Data Option".  If that program is Unlimited, doesn't that mean that their default program is, by definition, *limited*?

And who the fuck in their right minds would even consider that "flexible data option"?   I can't even see how this kind of program is in any way "fair" to the consumer.  You have to cut your usage of the internet by more than 98% to qualify for a $5 reduction, and if you go one byte over that, not only do you not get the reduction, you get the privilege of paying them an amount so large it makes a mafia shakedown seem tame by comparison.  

At least they stopped trying to blame this on "congestion".   But to say that this is in the interest of "fairness" is laughable since there's not a single solitary benefit to the consumer.  A plan of "If you use more than the X GB allotment, you will be billed an extra $10 per 50 GB.  If you use less than the X GB allotment, you will be credited $10 for every 50 GB that is unused" would be a hell of a lot more fair than this crap.  (I'm not endorsing that plan, btw.  Just saying at least there's the potential benefit to the consumer who really does do nothing more than Facebook and Email and probably barely cracks 50 GB a month.)

The whole thing is sickening.  But they'll probably get away with it because (A) they have monopoly control in most areas they're pulling this shit in, (B) it's nearly impossible for consumers to do anything about it, and (C) even if it does make its way through the courts, the case would take *years*, and Comcast would likely just walk away with a fine that's pennies compared to the obscene profits they'd be pulling in.

I think what gets me is this bullshit "increase". No, you're not actually doing anything. That 250GB plan was never actually a plan.  It was just some bullshit that you planned 5 years ago when you knew this day would come and you could screw your customers over as "doing them a favor".

I really hope the FCC takes to this. **If you are a customer affected by this, please contact the FCC**.

Dear FCC,

As I’m sure you are aware, Comcast has recently announced plans to begin enforcing a 300Gb data cap on a great part of it’s customer base.  I find this change extremely concerning as I see no reason  other companies won’t start following suit.  Natural monopolies, limited options, and shady contracts make it difficult or impossible for myself and many others to reasonably switch to another provider.

I’m asking you to do everything in your power to stop this trend before it starts.  The internet is not just a luxury anymore - it is a critical part of many people’s lives. As we’ve seen with cell phone data, once caps are in place, it is a race to the bottom to offer ever more limited data at ever increasing prices.

Regards,
{Your Name}

So it doesn't seem like Apple can unlock the phone for the FBI, but they can modify it to make the chances of breaking into it easier.

9090 :: Apple CEO Tim Cook directly responds to court order requiring decrypt...
I suggest everybody will have to install an additional door to their home with one master key, and this key will be given to the FBI. The key will also open any safe inside the house. Sometimes there's a need to search the house or even save people in it, and it's very difficult when the owner is not around. This way, the FBI will have access, to be used only in legitimate cases and truthfully, based on the good intentions of the agents. For our own good. Politicians and public figures are excluded. Unless they have something against the FBI, in which case this key will be used to get information that might shape their agenda and priorities. Again, for the public's benefit.

E\ many are saying the police can already break down your door. Well, yeah, they can also try to break down your phone/encryption. That's why I also added *safe* in my analogy. What if there's a safe the police can't open? or a safe that identifies brute force entry and destroys the content inside. In this analogy, the police are forcing the safe *maker* (not even the owner, mind you) to provide a master combination that will open any safe, any time. Yeah, I'm sure banks will roll just fine with that. And I'm sure the safes at FBI headquarters will also be this vulnerable. Hey, we should let the government sell safes and phones and bicycle locks. 

Oh also,a warrant got nothing to do with this. It's what makes the whole thing legal, without it they can't even look at your home/safe/phone. So it's not about that. It's about what happens next. It's like saying that once the police got a warrant to tap your phone, you can't speak in codes, because they won't understand it.

My favorite part.


"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that’s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks — from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable."

This literally happened to me... on a much smaller scale. When we moved into our house my wife called Comcast for a quote on Internet. Guy tried to sell her the most expensive super duper cable package. She said we just wanted Internet, got a quote, and said she would call back if we decide to go with them. We went with a competitor. 

A couple months later we start getting bills from Comcast for the super duper cable package. We never ordered anything from them and they never came to our house or installed anything. But it took like five months to get them to stop sending the mounting bills. Each time we called they just wanted to sell us the super duper cable package.

9018 :: Comcast failed to install Internet for 10 months then demanded $60,00...
You'd better believe that this kind of thing wouldn't happen if Comcast was regulated like a public utility or more competition was allowed in the marketplace. 

Either the PUC would require that Comcast provide service within a reasonable amount of time as they do with gas, electric, and water utilities, or another company with comparable service would step in to fill the gap. Unfortunately, current market structure and regulations prevent both of those things. 

In fact, an older post of mine is very relevant to this topic. See it below the line. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The market is structured in such a way as to give them (telecoms) an unfair advantage. 

Let me be clear. There are definitive economic benefits in allowing a company with incredibly high infrastructure costs to have a monopoly over a service area. In economics this is called [Natural Monopoly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). This prevents the duplication of efforts, and allows for a more efficient use of resources, avoiding [problems like this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2_HclPN8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/lgpoxpq2odq4bdbqaf3x.jpg) and [this](http://www.uh.edu/engines/nycandwires.jpg) (early 20th century NYC), where countless companies have overlapping, redundant infrastructure. 

Due to the market power this gives a company, they must also be heavily regulated in order to prevent them from taking advantage of their customers. The alternative is to allow governments to take on this function for themselves. 

The thing is, all water, gas, and electric utilities are heavily regulated by state and federal agencies in a way that telecoms are not. The three so-called "public" utilities are seen as necessities for life, while telecom has only recently begun to be viewed that way. As a result, public utilities cannot charge excessive fees for service, and in exchange we give them a near-monopoly over their service territory.

In California, for example, regulatory requirements only allow gas and electric utilities to make money on capital investments. This gives utilities a direct incentive to invest in new infrastructure, because that's how they make money. This simultaneously removes any incentive to overcharge per kWh or to induce customers to use more electricity - even if they did, California utilities wouldn't make any additional money from this practice. 

Instead, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) authorizes a certain rate of return - usually a 5%-10% markup on base electricity cost - based on capital investments and how well the utility runs its business. (Bit of an oversimplification here - this is called "decoupling" if you want to look for more details.)

*If we had a policy like that for telecoms, you can bet it would be cheaper and bandwidth would be higher.*

What's more, most states don't restrict a city's right to establish a utility for water, gas, or electric. So why do we do that for telecoms? 

Telecoms, meanwhile, are given the same preferential access to service territories in most states, but are not subject to the same price controls. They exploit this advantage by charging unreasonable prices, lagging behind in infrastructure investment and in providing higher bandwidth, and instituting datacaps that, by Comcast's own admission, are there exclusively to pad the bottom line (see [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151001/05131832403/as-comcast-broadband-usage-caps-expand-company-still-refuses-to-admit-they-even-have-caps.shtml), [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml), and [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150814/12144431948/comcast-admits-broadband-usage-caps-are-cash-grab-not-engineering-necessity.shtml) for details). 

If we're going to allow a company monopolistic control over a service territory, we can't also allow them carte blanche with their price structure. Basic economics says they'll abuse the privilege, and *that's exactly what they've done.*

This is one of many examples of what we economists would call a market failure. Part of the problem is the way the regulatory agencies view telecom. It needs to be considered a necessity and regulated in the same manner as a public utility. Recent changes at the FCC have moved in the right direction, but there's a lot further to go. 

Sources: I have a [M.S. in Ag and Resource Econ](http://i.imgur.com/vdJAsWQ.jpg?1) and worked for Pacific Gas & Electric. 

**TL;DR:** In a modern, 21st century economy, telecom access is a necessity, just like electric, water, and gas, and should be regulated as such. When you allow a company to have unfettered control over a service area without also regulating their business practices and cost structure, the customers (read: everyone) lose.  

There are other alternatives to publicly regulated monopolies, as well, such as increased competition (which would require more regulations to reduce entry barriers) or publicly owned utilities such as the municipal broadband in Chattanooga, TN. These are also perfectly valid solutions to this problem, but it all comes back to natural monopolies in the end.

I have been fighting this for weeks and have given up, accepting my slow internet fate and their ability to deny me a public utility for no reason at all.

I recently moved about 30 miles and was perfectly happy with At&t. I had an appointment for a tech to come out on a Friday to install our internet. On Thursday, they call saying they need to postpone installation because of "network issues" and they would reschedule for the weekend. Friday- no word, Saturday and Sunday- no word. I check back mid week, they say they will come out the next Friday, again they cancel... I finally get fed up and talk to a manager and an engineer. The engineer tells me the issue due to the fact that they can't fit me on their network in the area. I ask "Does that mean I need to wait until someone cancels their service and leaves?" He replies "yes". I ask if they have an idea of when someone will leave, he says "you can never tell, could be months". Then they acted hurt when I said I was cancelling my service.

TL:DR- after moving, AT&T strung me along for a week, knowing they couldn't install service at my house. I could have waited months if I hadn't been persist and uncovered the truth.

When I informed Comcast that I was moving to a different apartment (~2 miles from my previous apartment) they told me that "since no one in [the new apartment] had used Comcast for over 2 years" they would "need to send a field technician" to the new place to "'check the wiring' and ensure I could still use their cable Internet service" (wut? its a fucking coaxial cable)  They told me it would cost me $40 to send the technician over.  I told them I'd call them back.  Instead, I just packed all the Comcast gear up, moved it to my new apartment and hooked it up. Surprise! it works just fine!
Moral of the story is Comcast will tell any lie it can to its customers to try to suck more money out of them.

Naturally we're not going to hear any kind of retraction from most of the "news" sources that reported that encryption was being used. 

We're also not going to hear anyone roll back the blame that they've placed on Snowden for (allegedly) making our intelligence-gathering capabilities better known. 

Why? Because they're great distractions from the fact that the intelligence agencies that are trying to do away with encryption *aren't even capable of catching this when there's no encryption involved.*

If they can't track the terrorists when they're not using encryption, how would doing away with encryption make anything any easier?

The reality is that the broad gathering of data on everyone's activities means that the haystack is just too large to have any chance of finding the needle.

Looking at all the facts which have come to light, what I took away from this incident was the same thing I took away from 9/11: all the information to try to stop this was right there and obtainable by legal means already being used to thwart terrorism.  This was a problem of the government failing to use resources at hand to even try and stop the terrorism.  Giving the government more power or blaming the wrong causes will not fix the problem, but will make things even worse.  I would hope the French would learn from America's mistakes and not make the same knee-jerk mistakes and give up freedoms because of easily manipulated fear and anger.

I work at a very large company that treats me well, pays decently, and respects my family life balance. In the past few years many of my friends have left for Amazon, Google, Apple, and others to "get paid what they deserve". When they left I too interviewed and had many offers, such as these two gems...

Amazon team 1- They have a thing called "pager rotation" which means a team of 5 take weekly turns carrying a pager. If you get paged you have 15min to log in wherever you are day or night, or you could lose your job. I asked how was I supposed to buy groceries or go to get gas or whatever. The answer I got from the team lead was "You have a wife, don't you?"

Amazon team 2- This team had no pager rotation but they "allowed employees to bring in their own equipment". For example a printer, monitor, even your work computer could be furnished by yourself! I kind of sat silent while the team lead explained this amazing idea of me paying for my own supplies, then I asked "So what if I don't want to provide it myself? How do I get what I need?"  The short answer is you don't. You have to supply all of your own equipment for the privilege of working there.

This is all very true.  I worked for Amazon a few years ago for about 6 months at one of their DCs as a PM/IE.  This is pretty much spot on.  I never knew who was going to be at the desk next to me each day bc people left/got fired (sorry, coached out).  My manager changed twice in that time period and my bosses' boss changed once.  Recruiters always thought it was cool to see it on my resume but I always mentioned that it was a toxic environment and that the average management tenure was like 10 months (glad to see my estimate wasn't far off).  I leave it off my resume now bc it's seen as a bad thing by good companies and a good thing by shitty companies - the kind I wouldn't want to work for anyways.  And it's not like I'm a crappy employee or anything, I've worked up from the bottom of my current company  (a good sized and rapidly growing software company) to be a Director of North American Services.  I got out before it was this bad, but man was the writing on the wall.  At first it seems kind of awesome and impressive - all the cool ideas and super smart, dedicated people, but then you realize that their true plan is to extract all the energy, talent, and creativeness out of you in the shortest possible time and then discard the empty, worthless scraps for other companies to try to find a nugget or two left.

Ads are stealing my time. It's now common for a site to show a 30 second ad before a 10 second video clip.

I enabled pop-up blockers back in the 90s because they were annoying.  Then advertisers found a way around that and that setting in most browsers effectively does nothing.

I became a ClickToFlash user for the longest time, because my next annoyance was videos in news stories and video ads that would suddenly play.

Then, the advertisers adapted to that.

So, after two decades of trying to be a good sport and let the advertiser get ad "impressions" from my web use, I installed AdBlock.

I must say, the web is a quieter, more pleasant place, so long as I can update my filters to match the adaptations of advertisers.

I've actually read a convincing argument that from the perspective of advertisers, ad blocking software are actually helpful. 

The argument was that people who were aware of advertising and likely to block it weren't the eyeballs they wanted to target and by blocking ads, they saved the advertisers from paying for those impressions. 

The ones hurt by ad blockers are content creators. I think we're going to see a much more thorough transition to paid contact. Stuff like Vessel's system which can coexist with YouTube or Patreon where content creators can receive direct contributions. The age of being able to thrive off of just ads has been over for a very long time and it's only going to be a matter of a time before the market finds a new stable configuration.

Wrong. As blocking becomes more prevalent, ads will be more invasive. They will be intimately integrated in such a way that they are indistinguishable from normal content. This is already seen on certain blogs where entire posts are sponsored by an advertiser, the content of the post is primarily designed to bring awareness to the product while masquerading as normal content.

People on Reddit always wonder why the younger generation doesn't vote or get involved in politics. While I certainly can't speak for everyone, shit like this is the main reason I hear for their negligence. We raised our voices and fought against SOPA and CISPA, and won. And then Congress just said: "Thanks, but we're doing it anyway."

It's hard enough in today's world to feel your voice matters, and its nearly impossible when your government tells you to your face it doesn't. To many, its starting to seem like public opinion is just a courtesy that officials more and more frequently ignore. We need to speak up to see real change, but many need to see real change before they speak up.

This really just puts into law what has already been happening for years. I work at AWS in EC2, in 2013 I was working my teams ticket queue. A high priority sev3 came in and someone pinged me to look at the ticket it right away. The ticket was a request from the US government for a full memory dump and copy of the EBS volumes for a number of IP be sent to the US government(ticket didn't mention which agency just a place to put the data). I asked the requester to upload any legal documents(warrant, subpoena, etc) to the ticket while I contacted legal. About 2 minutes later, while I was still tracking down who in legal to contact about this, I was approached by a senior principal engineer(highest level you can get as an engineer at Amazon) and told NOT to contact legal, delete any mention for the ticket that was in my e-mail, and he would be taking over the ticket. He promptly handed over everything requested.


The article mentions sites like Reddit as being concerned about CISA, as they should. But it really doesn't matter when your cloud provider will just give the government any data they request without even notifying you.

"The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities."

Coded messages don't require encryption. All you need are pre-arranged code words. They can be transmitted in plain text and nobody will ever break the code unless your operational security is weak and someone leaks the code words.

Or you can do your own encryption. A simple [book cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cipher) is unbreakable if you don't know what they are using as the code book. It could even be something so simple and ubiquitous as the Paris phone book, in fact, it's even better if it's something so common. You can add more security like when I transmit a page number, we all agreed that really means pagenum+17 or some arbitrary offset. Then it won't matter if they discover your code book, as long as they don't have the offset number.

And none of this requires sophisticated technology.

You mean they just used plain unencrypted, unhidden, plain-text messaging with their real names like their user name like it was an AOL Chat Room in 1995? So why the hell is everyone [trying to outlaw encryption, and pass more anti-privacy laws](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/intelligence-agencies-pounce-paris-attacks-pursue-spy-agenda) while using these attacks as an excuse?

If this is entirely true, I am again completely disgusted at the way the media portrays EVERYTHING.  Last week, a guy on CNN was saying that Edward Snowden was partially responsible for the Paris attacks because he made the world aware of the surveillance going on, giving them reason to learn to hide their steps.  The anti-Encryption rhetoric on tv news right now is so over the top, and I have no doubt that the fact that encryption had nothing to do with these attacks will not even get a moments time on mainstream media.

8582 :: Man finds vulnerability in Starbucks's gift card system, responsibly ...
Fine Starbucks, next time a vulnerability is found the person should instead simply publicly release the information and you can deal with the consequences. That is some PhD level PR work you're doing there.

8582 :: Man finds vulnerability in Starbucks's gift card system, responsibly ...
Update: [Here's proof for this story.](https://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/128532-the-old-gamerushblockbuster-thread/page-32). My CAG username is "kunai." You can just follow from that page and also see other crazy epic scores I've made. (Like the insane "Get any 5 games for $5 each" Blockbuster promo).

------

Back in the day (2007/2008) I found a major flaw in the POS at Blockbuster

Their system would update overnight, but only certain parts, and these parts were on different days of the week. Their new item prices would update on Thursday, their used prices would update on Friday- BUT their trade-in values would update after closing on Sunday.

This meant if a game dropped in MSRP, it's new version would first lower on Thursday morning ($49.99 to $19.99) and be cheaper than the used version. The next day, on Friday morning, it's used version would be lowered ($47.99 to $17.99).

The trade-in value would still be the same- usually $30-$35, even though you could pull the game off the rack, buy it for $20, then trade in back without leaving the line.

I did this a few times and felt bad so I emailed corporate to let them know about the loophole. They told me they didn't take in information/suggestions from outside parties, essentially because they had that set up as part of their "business strategy."

I then proceeded to assist them in their endeavors by buying 25+ copies of Beowulf from Best Buy for $9.99 ($19.99-$10 coupon) and trading them in for ~$800 in store credit.

Then I repurchased all 25 copies with the store credit for ~$500.

Then I traded them in again.

Then I bought them again.

I did this a few times over the weekend and ended up with $1200 in store credit from $250 cash. 

Then I found a few games GameStop gave good money for and traded them in over there for store credit. I made some preorder and eventually canceled them and requested cash back for the deposit.

I eventually got a letter from Blockbuster banning me from trading, but it had the wrong date (post dated for the next year) and I kept trading.

I don't feel bad about it.

He deserved thanks and some respect for *helping them*. When someone goes through all the proper channels, and etiquette to help, and gets verbally slapped for it, the next time there's a way to exploit their mistakes why would anyone dare speak up? Are corporations really that stupid as to bite hands that feed them?

8582 :: Man finds vulnerability in Starbucks's gift card system, responsibly ...
We really need some kind of whistleblower type protection for vulnerabilities in web sites. There is a strong public interest in disclosing vulnerabilities to web site owners, but the way cybercrime is set up, generating the evidence to confirm a vulnerability essentially requires incrimminating yourself. Without protections, the entire thing is counter productive: if disclosure is as risky or more risky than using the information criminally, people will choose to do the latter, either themselves or passively by just not disclosing the bugs so that black hats eventually discover them themselves.

8582 :: Man finds vulnerability in Starbucks's gift card system, responsibly ...
Funny story; there is this cute little buffer overflow in all the Call of Duty games since MW2 due to the developers copypasting the code for each new game. Each year for about four years I've tried to tell them about it, hoping that they'll change their attitude since the game runs with elevated privileges and an attacker would get full control over the victims system.

Each time they just tell me to contact tech support, tech support forwards me to some senior tech support which basically says "we are tech support, we can't fix any bugs". When I explain the severity they just disconnect and ignore any further messages.

So a few months ago some, not necessarily bad, people in a steam/CoD modding group found out about it independently and used it to gain access to some server hosting company which let them leak a lot of files and debug symbols for some games.

Naturally Activision wasn't too happy about it and two months later they patched the most recent games. The slightly older titles like MW2 and MW3 are still vulnerable 5 months down the road. I've tried to tell them that it's not fixed yet but, like mentioned above, when disclosing information they just say that it's not their problem.

Speaking of Activision, do not try to help them, if you do then they'll send lawyers after you for violating their copyright rather than fixing it; http://puu.sh/hJyMj/af875ab002.png http://puu.sh/hSyDb/2213d71d9e.png

This is another one of many 'Shoot the messenger' responses from corporate closed mind thinking. "We can do no wrong, therefore by discovering that we did something wrong, since it cannot be us that did something wrong, it absolutely must be you. And you must be punished for catching us."

8518 :: TPP leaked: final draft of the intellectual property chapter, which s...
I know everyone is aware that the TPP was written mainly by industry insiders, but how about this?

Ron Kirk was the US Trade Representative from 2009-2013, and wrote a large part of the TPP. After he quit he almost immediately started working for Gibson Dunn, where he's ["living his dream as a big-time lawyer with international reach"](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140104-ron-kirk-back-in-dallas-in-dream-legal-political-role.ece). The company website says "from high-stakes litigation to the protection of vital intelligence property, we are the partners you can rely on". 

So to summarize, he went from writing the biggest pro-intellectual property trade agreement in history, ostensibly for the good of the people, to being paid a lot of money by a company living off of protecting intellectual property.

(c) where applicable and appropriate, the use of databases or digital libraries containing traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources; and

(d) cooperation in the training of patent examiners in the examination of patent applications related to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources.

**Excluding medical procedures, plant and animal genetics from patents**

3. Each Party may also exclude from patentability: diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or
animals; animals other than microorganisms; and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals,

**8 year patent protection for Biological patents**

1. With regard to protecting new biologics, a Party shall either:
(a) with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new
pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic62,63, provide effective market protection through the implementation of Article QQ.E.16.1 and Article QQ.E.16.3 mutatis mutandis for a period of at least 8 years

**mandatory creation of laws against music piracy**

7. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, enabling a copyright owner who has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, where such information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing such copyright.

**Fining companies who do not participate (secondary liability)**

3. require Internet Service Providers carrying out the functions referred to in paragraph 2(a) and 2(c) to participate in a system for forwarding notices of alleged infringement, including where material is made available online, and where they fail to do so, subjecting them to pre-established monetary damages for that failure;

holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services
measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price. [Damages aren't tied to the value of the item]

In civil judicial proceedings, with respect to infringement of copyright or related
rights protecting works... each Party shall establish or
maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:
(a) pre-established damages, which shall be available upon the election of the
right holder; or
(b) additional damages ( For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages.) [This clears the way for, but doesn't require, cash settlements in addition to the value of the copyrighted work.] 

Pre-established damages under paragraphs (7) and (8) shall be set out in an amount
that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the
infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements

In awarding additional damages under paragraphs (7) and (8), judicial authorities
shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider appropriate,
having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the infringing conduct and the
need to deter similar infringements in the future

judicial authorities
shall, at least, have the authority to:
(a) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody
of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited
activity;

A Party may provide that damages shall not be available against a nonprofit library,
archives, educational institution, museum, or public noncommercial broadcasting entity that sustains the burden of proving that such entity was not aware or had no reason to
believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity

Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least
in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a
commercial scale. In respect of willful copyright or related rights piracy, “on a commercial
scale” includes at least:
(a) acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and
(b) significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain,
that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or
related rights owner in relation to the marketplace.

With respect to the offenses for which this Article requires the Parties to provide
for criminal procedures and penalties, Parties shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding
and abetting is available under its law.

Where a Party requires the identification of items subject to seizure as a
prerequisite for issuing any such judicial order, that Party shall not require
the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them
for the purpose of seizure. [A lot of stuff like this. Making sure that the process for suing is easy and can be done without much evidence]

[TRADE SECRETS] 
(c) the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret;
(e) the acts are detrimental to a Party's economic interests, international
relations, or national defense or national security. [It's criminal if it makes the company look bad?]

[ISPs]
limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief
against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements. [Countries must change their laws if they shield ISPs from cash liability for copyright infringement]
referring or linking users to an online location by using information location
tools, including hyperlinks and directories.
[Countries must also change laws that shield hyperlinks from monetary damages] 

Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in
accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process
and privacy, enabling a copyright owner who has made a legally sufficient claim of
copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider
information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, where such
information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing such copyright. [ISPs must hand over user info, this in addition to previous statements deteriorating burdens of proof, is powerful]

Why are you fining us for calling our green apples red!?!  
Red apples sell better!

*Because your apples aren't red, they're green.*

They're a little bit red. They're practically yellow. Orange, almost.

*Then call them yellow. Or orange.*

But red apples sell better!

*But you don't sell red apples.*

We sell great apples! Most people won't even notice the difference! They're about as good as red as far as our "good", non-problem customers are concerned.

*You may be selling great apples, but they're not red, so don't call them red.*

But red apples sell better! You're hurting our profits!

*You can't profit by lying to your customers.*

We're not lying! What an outrageous suggestion! We're selling great apples!

*But not red apples.*

Red apples, almost-red apples, what's the difference?!?

*If it's no difference to you, great, just call them green or yellow or orange.*

But red apples sell better!

*So there is a difference. Truthfully advertise that difference.*

What you call truth in advertising isn't necessary. It would hurt our bottom line. Red apples sell better. We're entitled to those profits!

As a result I get all sorts of legit but misdirected email one of which was an Ashley Madison account back in 2011.  Because it was, well, Ashley Madison I wrote to their support explaining the situation and requesting the account be deleted. 

I received back:
"Dear someotherguysnick,

Thank you for your email.

Our records show that your account has been successfully deleted.

Man, blackmail is a piece of cake in the age of technology. I mean, how many intelligence agencies do you think run compromising websites like Ashley Madison to keep files on potential politicians one day.

You do something sleazy as a 28 year-old, and try to run for Congress as a 52 year-old . . . only to find out that all your embarrassing sexual data is on file (and used to put pressure on you by unsavory interests).

When Barack Obama first became a candidate for senate, the NSA started tapping his phones (and all the phones of anyone who knew him or worked with him. As well as email.). See here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-nsa-spied-on-barack-obama-2004-russ-tice-2013-6

And who can forget Governor Elliot Spitzer who was spied on (using the Patriot Act)? Abusing a law that was ostensibly to go after terrorists, they applied the statute unethically whereby they discovered that the Governor used prostitutes. Once he started opening investigations into Goldman Sachs [prior to the 2008 financial meltdown] that information was leaked to the Press and he was politically neutralized [with all investigations into Wall Street fraud tabled]. Spitzer resigned in shame--and Goldman Sachs went right back to their illegal activities, culminating in the largest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression.

Same thing with Senator Larry Craig. I remember when it was leaked to the press that he was hitting on men in an airport bathroom, and Chris Matthews on MSNBC said, "This event happened three years ago. Why release it now?"

He very astutely realized that Craig had a "blackmail file". That stuff is kept locked up tight in the eventuality that, one day, a politician doesn't vote "the right way". Then, and only then, is the information leaked.

My point in all this? It'd be enlightening to see exactly where the seed money came for Ashley Madison. Who funded it? Who gave the creator the startup capital?

(It'd be interesting to trace the money and see if it's like Facebook, with its million connections to the intelligence agencies. And it's worse than just the NSA or the CIA. Intelligence agencies like Israel's Mossad or Britain's MI6 may very well be creating sites with the intention of blackmailing US politicians.)

Isn't the more interesting and troubling fact that Ashley Madison seemed to promise affairs...but was only patronized by men, for the most part? So only gay men ever had a shot at finding someone on the site, but Ashley Madison portrayed itself as a hotbed of heterosexual hookups.        

The unscrupulous were being scammed by the even *more* unscrupulous. How are you going to be surprised that a site predicated on *multiple layers of dishonesty* was lying when it offered you a "full delete" option?

8290 :: Kim Dotcom: Mega 3.0 will succeed as a nonprofit "Copyright extremism...
This idea has been around and obvious to everyone for how long? nearly 15 years now?


While i'm grateful there's netflix... there should be way more than just that by now.




edit: I just thought i'd expand my last sentence a bit since it's getting a lot of traffic.  Obviously i'm aware there's more than just netflix.  I could have phrased it better by saying the service we get should be a lot better by now, and it should have evolved much more.

By that, my ideal would be maybe a few different providers for competition, maybe some who you pay per viewing, or pay per content you watch for as long the service exists.. or some with a monthly fee.

But more importantly, everyone would have a lot more content... and I hate the exclusives... though that's a bit tricky because I think some shows just got renewed/picked up again because of it.

Still, I like to choose something like that based on actual service and price... not content.  and I don't want to get two services either.  I just want one that's good and has everything ;/

This is a fair statement, but Kim Dotcom makes an incredible amount of money off of intellectual property that doesn't belong to him. Saying that those who claim generating content should have the right to make money off of their creations is "copyright extremism" is ludicrous. The culture of free has completely devalued intellectual property. 

I'm not saying that copyright should be policed as it has. So far, all attempts at regulation have been a total failure. 

But it's important to bear in mind that Kim Dotcom is not some heroic prophet for the Internet. He's someone who has profited greatly from the content created by others. Even an attempt at a non-profit is still a thinly veiled excuse to live off of the intellectual works of others. 
155
8290 :: Kim Dotcom: Mega 3.0 will succeed as a nonprofit "Copyright extremism...
Kim Dotcom continues to show himself as a simplistic Libertarian. I'd love to have everything ever made available ubiquitously but there's far more than just one cabal of record and movie companies controlling things.

Every person involved in a production, every rightsholder, every musician, every actor - they all have contracts and varying amounts of rights. It's a spiderweb of permission and restriction that's slowly evolved over 80 years, and we have to respect everybody's contractual right to withhold permission or renegotiate their royalties if they want. Current technological change is outpacing things like decades of precedent contract law and industry models and that's what's slowing things down. Law has always lagged behind technological progression.

It's frustrating, and we'll get there eventually as the industry continues to modernise its contracts and rights systems - but Dotcom wants a free-for-all (as he's always done) at the expense of a sustainable future model where everyone who deserves their slice of the pie gets it.

I've never liked Dotcom. Whilst making millions at the expense of your favourite music and TV (yes, he also directly impacted the financial wellbeing of your favourite artists and actors), he played fast and loose with the law for years, tried to buy his way into citizenship and the favour of politicians and has just whined constantly since he got caught. I wish he'd shut up and go away.

8247 :: Comcast admits its 300GB data cap serves no technical purpose
So, whether or not this applies to the article, as a Comcast customer with the 300gb datacap, I've come to the realization that the purpose of the cap is to keep cable TV alive. When we lived in Florida and used Brighthouse, we cancelled out tv service since we could use netflix and amazon streaming, and in the end, we saved on our cable bill. Now that we're stuck with Comcast and their data cap, we only save money by having an Internet and cable tv bundle. We didn't even hook up the cable box because we wouldn't use it, since streaming services is what we preferred. But after 2 months of going over our data limits and being charged $70+ for overages, we had to connect the cable box if we wanted to watch anything on tv without eating into data. I'm a stay at home mom, so I use the Internet for educational programing as well as entertainment purposes, and the data cap limits what we can actually do.

What kind of statistic is "less than 98% of subscribers never go over the data cap"? Of course they don't, because there's exorbitant fees in the event that you do!

"I don't know anything about that as that is not in my department" is pretty much what he said, but media turned it into something else.

This article is so insanely stupid.  
The headline has very little to do with what the guy actually said.  
He dodged a question that he didn't know the answer to (as he should), and the publication spins it in the most twisted way possible.

8247 :: Comcast admits its 300GB data cap serves no technical purpose
My ISP implemented a data cap 250GB without telling any of their customers two years ago. We found out after our internet was completely cut off then they said that was one of our three strikes and if we do it two more times they are going to automatically charge us per gig (or 10 gigs). 

Found out that they "tried" to inform us. They added a slow ass pop-up on our browsers which we all through was just some crappy advertisement.

Fuck you Suddenlink

Fucking Comcast. So as you all know google Fiber is moving to Nashville. Comcast just conveniently upped my internet speed and slashed my bill. They also made 2 gig Internet available in my area. That only infuriates me more because this entire time they've had the capability and just let it sit there. Can't wait to move companies.

This is literally why people stop following politics. We protested against this legislation for over a year, but they ended up sneaking it as a rider onto a huge budget. It's exhausting. 

I have a family and a job, I am comfortable giving up some of my time to volunteer to email my congressman and fill out for letters about how, as a constituent, I do not agree with this. But for these people, this IS their job. All they do all day is devise ways to game the system and get stuff like this passed. I don't have that luxury.

**DO Not USE A FREE VPN SERVICE !!! ** 

You may as well be giving your info out.  

You get what you pay for.  Use a paid one with a dedicated server.  Private Internet Access (PIA) is a excellent choice.  Same concept with hush mail,  you pay.  

Also keep in mind,  if you're doing something really inappropriate like selling drugs,  people,  murder,  child porn,  non of this will keep you 100% safe if an agency really wanted to catch you.

1) [VPNs are not secure against the NSA](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/nsa-has-vpns-in-vulcan-death-grip-no-really-thats-what-they-call-it/).  They may prevent your ISP from watching what you do but it seems like your traffic is still an open book for the government.

2) The Tor browser is good, but as far as virtual machines I have to ask: how does a VM anonymize you?  CISA is all about spying on the Internet, and whether the system is your Windows box or a Linux VM the packets go over the same wire.  A VM is good for opening dodgy downloads or websites but I don't see how it could protect you from government surveillance.

One more suggestion I'd make is if you have a rooted Android phone, you can install Orbot and Orweb to get Tor on your phone.  With a rooted phone you can even route some or all of your apps through the Tor network.

8155 :: Court says net neutrality rules will go into effect today: Rules that...
People, please take note that under no circumstances does this mean the fight is over. We all need to stay informed and vigilant, and make sure that full net neutrality is preserved, and enforced when necessary. We have all shown that we are a force to be reckoned with, and that if we care about something on a wide enough spectrum, we will certainly make our voices heard. Let's not forget what we've accomplished so far, and keep fighting the good fight to make a better, more open Internet for us and generations to come!

**Edit 1:** I would like to take my moment in the spotlight to remind/inform all of you that [congress is voting today on fast-tracking the TPP](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/trans-pacific-trade-deal-vote), and that [this will impact Internet freedom in a myriad of ways](http://www.exposethetpp.org/TPPImpacts_InternetFreedom.html).

StormCloudsGathering also put out [a short and to-the-point video on the TPP](http://youtu.be/KnyPsKw_gak) yesterday, and I would love to get Aaron some exposure for all of the effort he puts into making his videos, and [confirming all of his sources](http://stormcloudsgathering.com/the-tpp-what-youre-not-being-told).

**Edit 2:** I can hardly express how happy I am that my top comment is about something as important as protecting the sanctity of the Internet. This enormous network is the greatest thing to ever happen to humanity, and I am so proud to know that I am not the only one who thinks so. Keep being awesome, everyone. Arm yourselves with knowledge, construct well-thought opinions/arguments, and inform others as best you can. Never stop asking questions. Oh, and have an awesome day. :)

**Edit 3:** To everyone who is complaining about the fact that the big bad government is the entity that would enforce net neutrality, I actually agree with you. I *do not* believe that the current political structure has the best interest of its citizens in-mind. I *do* believe that the government needs to be reigned-in in some ways, and a lot of things need to change. It starts with educating ourselves and having non-partisan, attainable goals, and assembling when necessary whether online or in public to make sure that our government serves US and not the other way around. I don't think a lick of sarcasm is going to help, and if appreciate it if we all stay as positive as we can while still remaining both level-headed and realistic. I really do get it. After all, behind every cynic is a disappointed optimist.

I wrote this a couple of days ago in a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3hvdzg/flash_is_dying_what_about_all_the_webgames/) on /r/games, and it seemed relevant here:

I am a web developer who has worked for several years with Flash and now HTML5 + Javscript.

Having developed games and applications in both mediums, I have to say that I will definitely be sad if Flash completely dies out. One of the things that drew me to building in Flash was that it was just so easy to pick up. I started out animating crappy sprite movies, and not long afterwards, I started drawing my own art and learning AS2 and AS3.

I think sites like Newgrounds flourished in part because Flash was so easy to start using. Having such accessible animation tools, a built-in coding environment, and a community of people eager to learn and teach each other definitely helped Flash cartoons & games become so prevalent across the net.

Nowadays, I can't say I have the same confidence in HTML5 + JS + Canvas as I did in Flash. Not to say that they can't achieve the same things ([this comment from /u/VeryAngryBeaver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3hvdzg/flash_is_dying_what_about_all_the_webgames/cub43a4) has a good summary of the comparisons between the two mediums today). What I'm saying is, the learning curve is steeper. That easy, inviting start is gone.

When I was learning Flash, all I needed to start with was Flash. Now that I'm doing HTML5 games, I need an image editor, a text editor, a coding environment, and I need to know how to code HTML and Javascript. Not impossible tasks, to be sure, but in combination, difficult enough that if that 14-year-old me tried to pick it up today because I wanted to make my crappy Mario vs. Sonic sprite animation, I can't speak for what other people would do, but I would likely get frustrated and give up.

I do remain optimistic, however, as programs like [Construct](https://www.construct3.com/)  and other HTML5 game building programs become more popular.

I know it's really easy hating on Flash and its many downsides (if a week goes by without the program crashing, I start to get worried), especially on the user-end. I just thought I would chime in from in a different perspective.

I've been developing web sites since 1993. I worked on SGML before HTML existed and contributed to the original HTML specification. 

When Flash came along I was one of the first to push its limits as a flashlite beta tester, long before actionscript. Then AS3 came along, and to be honest I thought it fucked up the experience. Sure, it was a more mature language but I liked the simplicity of the UI before.

Now that Flash is dying, over all I'm happy about it. But the hard truth that I am not seeing many people admit to, is that HTML5, CSS3, SVG and other technologies are not consistent across browsers and there is nothing that comes close to Flash as an authoring and especially animating & vector drawing platform for the web.

Saying that JavaScript and the soup of other standards like HTML5 can pick up the slack is bullshit in my opinion. Flash was a great product in its day and it will leave a huge hole when it's gone. Who is going to create something to fill it? So far every product I've seen looks like a beta. I mean, screw flash, don't get me wrong, but I'd like to see browser companies get together and collaborate on a new standard for animation and multimedia authoring for the web.

Ads are a necessary "evil", (come on nothing is free) however, they have proved to be far more evil than need be.

Do it. 

Media sites need to accept that they can't expect viewers to respect their rights to monetize while they continue to pollute search results to boost their ranking.

I am all for sites with whatever ad-based or subscription business model they want, but as long as they are abusing search results with paywalled information, I'm going to jump that fence and, moreover, look for better news sources.

Apple has been doing this for over a decade. There was a third party search tool called Watson, which Apple methodically copied into their own Sherlock tool. Watson fans were upset. Apple did not care. That was in 2002. They've been doing it ever since.

I don't necessarily disagree with their approach, but like it or not the Apple developer community has been on notice for over a decade that if you build a useful utility app in their ecosystem, they may well clone it into their OS with zero fucks given.
854
8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
Unfortunately this will be buried, but flux didn't call them out, and they released a statement saying they were happy that apple is using it because they have been telling apple to implement it for years.  The title is a lie 
167
8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
Apple doesn't have a problem with developers releasing source code for apps that use private API's like F.lux. Notably you can look up Gamma Thingy by Thomas Finch which does the same thing and is still available to sideload using Xcode.

The problem with the way the F.lux developers did it was they didn't provide source code. They wrapped their binary in a wrapper which Xcode compiled and installed. Using this exploit the F.lux team never had to share their code which is probably what Apple took as more of an offense.
229
8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
As soon as Apple opens up an API for that, there will be 50 F.lux clones on the App Store. Sure F.lux could do it better, but the best thing doesn't always win out, especially with tons of people making it confusing for the normies. F.lux is better as an integrated feature and Apple knows it.
Agree they could have at least given them some kind of attribution though.

8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
Google/Youtube has done the same thing to competing YouTube apps on the play store. The viral lite app(and others as well) used to allow you to listen to videos with the screen off or while using different apps(along with the ability to open a pop-up window video which they still have).

So YouTube made them remove that capability and then came out with "YouTube Red." Otherwise known as making you pay for a stupid prescription for something that should be a default feature of the app and already was in other apps.
32
8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
Just about everyone is missing the reason why f.lux cannot be side loaded. Initially f.lux did release an Xcode project that was able to be side loaded, but they did this different from all of the other side loaded projects. Instead of just releasing the project complete with source code, they exploited a bug in Xcode that allowed for installing an already compiled binary. Using this exploit, Pirates can just copy the binary from *any* iOS app and install it. You may wonder why the f.lux team would do it that way; why not just release the source? F.lux is not open source (which is their prerogative). There are also issues of what could be included in this binary file. We could put it through a disassembler, which would give us a pretty good idea of what it does, but that does not give us the whole picture. I highly doubt that they would put any nefarious code in, but without the source we cannot truly audit it. Supposedly f.lux makes no money, so it seems odd that after getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar that they would not just release the code. I understand and respect protecting their work, but something seems fishy. Though I suppose Apple could have banned it for using private APIs if they wanted too (maybe?) We may never know.

TL;DR: F.lux exploited a bug in Xcode, that was why they were banned. 
40
8002 :: F.lux creators call Apple out for releasing Night Shift after banning...
Let's be real. f.lux isn't going to get on the App Store anytime soon, because to implement its functionality, it would be breaking out of its own app sandbox.

While apps can do this now via defined extension points (3rd party keyboards, action extensions, audio plugins, etc...), the amount of engineering time and effort needed to write in an extension point for display control would probably be the same or greater than just plain implementing the functionality natively, but with more downsides.

Could it happen down the line? Never say never.

For those who aren't in the field; yes paywalls suck a big one. But what you don't fully understand is that the authors PAY to publish. That's right. We pay to publish in the journal for review (peer reviewers however are not paid), editing, printing, etc. 

So - journals collect a fee (~1k) to publish the article - then collect a fee (~$30) to read the article. All on research the government most likely paid for (in the US). What a gig, huh?
1443
7986 :: Researcher illegally shares millions of science papers free online to...
Fucking GOOD. Locking publicly funded research behind publisher paywalls (because researchers are so desperate to get published) should be illegal and it's through sheer academic apathy that it's gotten to this point in the Internet age where publishing information is so cheap as to be nearly free.

The publishers served a purpose before the world wide web but for the past 20 years they've been leeches. This is the kind of thing that [Aaron Swartz was fighting when MIT and federal prosecutors drove him to suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).

And that's about where the discussion on this ends to me.  We're in the internet era, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon.  Even the argument that the fees go to support stellar peer review is a false one.  A widely disseminated scientific paper is going to get a lot more effective peer review than some of the absolute garbage "science!!" that's published in supposedly peer-reviewed journals.

The best day of my Internets is when Comcast called to tell me that my speeds were going down and my monthly fee was going up. But for a limited time offer they could guarantee my current speeds for only $10 more per month.

I told them to cancel my service.

Suddenly my speeds were going to stay the same and I wouldn't have to pay anything additional.

I still cancelled and switched to FiOS. No regrets.

I am lucky enough to have a local cable company.  They keep up with the times, though they may be behind sometimes.  

My service rarely goes out, and when it does, they have a message on the phone by the time I call them giving an eta, usually about 10 minutes, maybe twice a year.

Also, if I have a question I call one local number, press 1 for an operator, and rarely do I get placed on hold.  They usually answer withing a ring or two, and my question/problem is taken care of within a few minutes.

My favorite story is when my remote stopped working on a Sunday afternoon.  The (only) office was closed but helpdesk picked up. They said if I could drive there (3 minutes away from them ) they would come out to the car and give me a new one.  

10 minutes later I was watching TV at home with a brand new remote.

It is a family business, and the owner's kids, now grown up, are starting to run the business.  One has a degree in marketing while the other has her MBA in business and a degree in finance.

How do I know all of this?  The kids went to the local public school and the family is always working with the community on one event or another.  My nephew is still friends with them and they are no spoiled rich kids.

TL;DR - I love my cable provider.

Does Hola do this when it's "off"? I literally use Hola for about 30 seconds once a week during football season. I start a connection outside the US so I can launch NFL Game pass, and once it's launched I disconnect the VPN.

I have a friend that was affected by this.  They used the pin they were provided last year and when they attempted to submit their return, they discovered that it had already been submitted.  

When they contacted the IRS they were gleefully informed that their refund had already been mailed.  When they informed the IRS that they actually owed quite a lot of money and this same thing happened last year the response was basically 'uh oh'.

The takeaway is that, not only was the IRS compromised again, but that the IRS is not even bothering to check that they are sending refunds to people whose accounts were hacked the previous year, even though those people have owed the IRS money for several years running.

**This** is why you don't want a government having access to your electronics without a warrant. Ok. There's MANY reasons, but it's a pretty damn good one.

Just going to point out that when you cut the IRS budget they are going to use the cheapest means to protect data and run the ship.  All reports are they are massively underfunded(on purpose).  If you want properly running government you can't simply cut your way to efficiency.  Some things, like cyber security,  are expensive to implement properly.  And because our representatives tend to be older, tech illiterate, ideologically stunted, or just plain stupid they do not fund these things correctly or take them seriously enough.

I wish they'd legislate from the other end: let you tell your credit card company that a certain service has been canceled and no longer has the right to pull funds from your account. If they want to drag their feet shutting it off, that's their problem, but the billing stops immediately either way.  It's annoying that we can't already do this. 

_EDIT:_ I did try this, IIRC, several years ago. I believe it was when I tried to cancel my membership at Bally's. Credit card company told me no, I couldn't deny a company the right to charge my card, if they already have the info for it. Disputing a *past* charge is one thing, preventing future charges is another. At least that's what I was told then .... if things have changed, I'm glad.

7758 :: Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: "The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Unintere...
"It’s an exciting job. We’re doing a lot behind the scenes that people have not seen yet."

That is the sentence that worries me. This sounds like she wants to fix reddit through new features. Which, done by of a ceo that did not understand her product or the users using it, will be the thing that hurts reddit the most in the end.
1228
7758 :: Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: "The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Unintere...
I've been trying to give her the benefit of the doubt but this comment from Pao demonstrates both:

1. She has no understanding of the business model her own company uses because the vocal minority of Reddit is what produces the content to attract the majority to the site.
2. She is so out of touch with the community that she makes comments like this and doesn't have the wisdom to know that they will not be received well.

The CEO of a company should never make comments like this.  It's self-serving and protectionist.  It lowers yourself into the weeds AND is ultimately harmful to the company (most importantly).  She would have been better off saying nothing from a PR standpoint.

This just builds on the fact that they let a key face of the company go abruptly and unexpectedly without any kind of coordinated message.  This is very basic PR.  If you have a well known employee who you want to terminate (for whatever reason) then you need to have them issue a statement that makes it sound like they're pursuing better opportunity and it was their choice to leave (in exchange for either a golden parachute or not disclosing whatever horrible thing they did depending on the situation).  So it's another case of Chairman Pao is showing incompetence in the basic mechanics of how to run a business.  It's no wonder she didn't make partner at her last job because so far everyone is wondering how she ever got the one she has now.

The big thing that people on the board of Reddit Inc need to understand is that Reddit is what it is because it gets out of the users way and people in turn choose to build vibrant communities on it.  Between the censorship and shadow banning and the desire to control the AMA process so that guests can have pre-screened questions (which would just turn AMA into a CNN interview) the community is upset because we like Reddit and all remember what happened to Digg.  We don't want to see a Voat post in a year saying Reddit has been bought by Dice for an embarrassing amount of money.  

This is a case where the majority of the community that actively makes Reddit a top 100 website is trying to help keep Reddit from making self-destructive decisions.  The board should see this and move to replace Chairman Pao with leadership that understands the company and its business model.

Here's the thing, she's right, but she is also (probably) fundamentally misunderstanding how a site like reddit works.

I'm going to make up some numbers, disagree with them all you like, but I'm just using them to get to a core idea.

Reddit's key 'value' to those who own it is: Monthly active users, Pageviews. The pageviews are in the billions, the MAU are in the hundreds of millions.

Let's assume: 85% of those MAU are just readers. 10% are commenters. 5% are submitters.

Those are the numbers I made up, and they may not be accurate, but I think they are probably a good overall pattern to judge the site. Most of the folks are totally disinterested in the nitty gritty politics of the site because they are just passive readers. They view reddit as a place for cat memes and interesting news. They come here for the CONTENT and not the IDENTITY.

But here's the problem, that CONTENT is being created by the 15% that comprise the commenters and the submitters. They are ones bringing in the clickbaity titles and the superfresh news and the memes and the pun threads, everything we love about reddit. Those are a more passionate and hardcore crowd, the ones who view reddit as IDENTITY, and those are the ones who are currently frothing for various reasons.

She's right, the 85% probably won't be swayed by everything that's going on and won't leave for political reasons, but what if the 15% is and does?

Without the content, the 85% will leave too. They are here because they are the audience to the cast of performers built of the 15%.  I don't think the admins are viewing the system from that perspective, and if that's true, the site's dead man walking.

edit: a word, thanks to the grammer nazis. thank you, grammer nazis. i'll be miss you the mostest of all.

She's right.

The vast majority of Reddit users don't give a damn.

The vast majority of Reddit users didn't even notice.

The vast majority of Reddit users rarely even hit the voting buttons.

Reddit is not the vast majority of Reddit users.

Reddit is the communities that *attract* those users, and those communities don't exist without the moderators, the dedicated users, and the content creators.

Of *those* people, damn near all of them give a damn, and they're very, *very* upset with how this whole affair was handled.

Saying the "vast majority of Reddit users are uninterested" is the equivalent to saying "the vast majority of the United States is uninterested in its infrastructure."

No duh.

They'd sure be pissed off if it stopped working, though, and firing Victoria without any warning threw a huge wrench into the works.

Ellen Pao is out-of-touch with the company that she runs, the service it provides, and the people who use it. In her ongoing quest to make it a safe, marketable environment, she is driving it into the ground.

7695 :: A Trail of Evidence Leading to AT&T’s Partnership with the NSA
Around 8 years back I used to live out in the boonies near Kansas City.  Only internet we could get was from some guy who leased space on towers to install some of his own wireless gear to service folks like us in the sticks.  He was out installing the equipment at the house and I asked him about his business.  He was telling me how he had dedicated lines from the towers back to the main telco facilities.  Then he told me about how there was a secret room at one of those facilities. He said that some of the main fiber lines split off and went into this room.  Nobody had access and nobody really knew what was in the room.  He said he thought it was probably the FBI or NSA, but he wasn't sure.  I thought he was full of shit and just some tinfoil hat guy.  Now....I'm beginning to think he wasn't so full of shit.

William Binney worked for the NSA for over 30 years and was considered one of their greatest mathematicians. Listen to what he has to say about the spying program(s) he developed and how they are being used on everyone in this country (USA).

They are building a profile on you so that they can string together every aspect of your entire life. With any type of policy change in the government they can then go back and pick out any aspect of it to use against you as they see fit. Don't forget they even have secret courts for this now. That is the really scary part of all of this.

"Just because we call our self a democracy doesn't mean we will stay that way" - William Binney

When you hear someone brush it off as just collecting metadata, let them know about William Binney and what he did against the USSR and how those programs are now being used on them.

When I read about Big Telco's relationship with the NSA, I'm reminded of the story of Qwest's former CEO, [Joseph Nacchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Nacchio) and how he was imprisoned for insider trading.  Nacchio says was [approached by the the NSA](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-story-of-joseph-nacchio-and-the-nsa-2013-6?IR=T) to provide unfettered access--much like Room 641A on Folsom Street--to Qwest's backbone.  After he refused Qwest's cooperation, government contracts dried up overnight and, subsequently, insider trading charges were filed.  Given Snowden's leaks and the subsequent evidence of their outrageous behavior, it's not hard to fathom that these charges were filed in retaliation for his refusal to open up Qwest's network.

“When we protect the rights of those among the least of us, we protect them for all of us.”

It amazes me how much people are willing to succumb to what is emotionally satisfying these days, when the cost is a complete disregard for principle.

I see people arguing in defense of murderers who kill because they are angry over cartoons.

Freedom of speech/expression is the backbone of all rights. Yet I see people today who argue that freedom of speech is not as important as the ability to conveniently silence those with disagreeable opinions. That people are certain they are qualified to make decisions on someone else's behalf about what they should be allowed to see, based on what they like for themselves.

Vigilantism is okay, as long as its someone who probably did something disgusting that's being targeted.

Doxxing is okay, as long as the people its happening to are douchebags. 

We never voted into law that dishonesty is a forfeit of the right to privacy.

How do we justify our own rights, when we allow others rights to be violated and taken away based on whether or not we like who is being victimized?

I really like what Benson did with USB C cable.

But I don't think Amazon is really serious about their policy, or doesn't realize the implications. There are many cables which aren't USB IF (implementer's forum) that people want and Amazon sells. For example no USB extender cable is USB IF compliant. USB full-size A to A wasn't compliant either, although I hear that's changed now.

Amazon themselves not only sell, but brand at least one non-USB IF cable.

good guy, what pisses me off is when the product is clearly not what was in the picture. 

I bought a set of 3 awesome 6 foot cords, straight up better than apple'a cords, they had a thicker coating, and the support near the ends of the charger is stronger. (pretty sure they were Xcords)

Tried to order the same exact product again, this time 6, and got these shitty black thin corded chargers, the plastic coating on it was so cheap and stuff none of them ever broke in to a manageable shape, I think 1 broke within the day, and the others didn't work all the time and many others broke throughout the month.

7554 :: U.S. congressmen introduce bill that stops states from banning strong...
Every time I hear people talking about building backdoors into encryption, I think about that time the TSA built backdoors (of a sort) into their luggage lock designs. 

TSA decided they needed to be able to open all luggage locks, so they required manufacturers to make all locks accessible by a master key that only the TSA was supposed to have. [The key designs were leaked and suddenly everyone could open every baggage lock.](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/84039/20150911/tsa-luggage-locks-compromised-after-master-key-designs-leak-online.htm)

I managed to convince my mostly computer illiterate grandparents by comparing encryption to bank vault.

A strong encryption is the shinny 2 ft solid steel door with all the fancy lock on it at the bank down the street.

A weak encryption is like the wooden front door of the house.

No encryption is like the public park across the street from the bank.

When you have sensitive or highly valuable stuff, do you keep it on the bench in the park, a closet in the house, or in a locked box in the bank's vault?

And now they believe encryption to be very important and the government is been stupid.

For the record, anyone who doesn't use Apple products or has a Jihad against them: I've been able to format my Hard Drives using AES encryption for years, and when you reformat a drive it gives you three options in OS X.

What aggravates me about this is that these apps already exist to some extent. Think about HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, even Comcast's own Xfinity Player app.

Comcast picks and chooses which platforms get to have access to these services that we are already paying for regardless of what the content producer would like.

Sure, they do this already with their streaming services, but they only work on certain devices for "convenience" or will only play SD quality so they don't clog up the tubes or whatever.
They will simply just give us an alternative, say it costs more, charge us more, put tons of restrictions on it (can only watch on-demand shows, no sports, no this, only that, etc.) and then say "see? we tried but nobody wants to use it"

I still can't get over from when Comcast released encrypted channels in my area, forced me to buy a box for every one of my TVs and claimed it was to bring me better service. I was fine with a single HD DVR on my main TV and the the basic 2-99 on my bedrooms.  I called and complained and they tried to say it was part of the analog/digital switch...  uhh... no?  you are already digital, and I have a digital tuner in my LCD TV in my bedroom...  you are now encrypting channels so you can charge $5 for each mini box that "get's more channels" like the original 2-99 plus like 15 duplicates over 100 and 20 korean channels.  Nobody seemed to care about that?

I would love for the FCC to simply say "stop encrypting your shit, let people use that now almost useless coax port (other than for OTA) on the back of their digital-capable TVs, and provide 100% of your content live/on-demand/ppv/etc on your website, and let people use whatever set top box they want... with NO ADDITIONAL COST"

Damn straight. I'm glad there are some sane voices on the side of the intelligence agencies who are speaking out against this ridiculousness. 

The unintended consequences of weakening encryption would be substantial, to say nothing of the legitimate privacy concerns. Information about backdoors built into programs by (or for) government agencies will inevitably fall into the hands of less-than-savory types. 

In the meantime, the baddies will use encryption of their own that doesn't have backdoors, so what we actually will have done is hamstring security for the law-abiding public.

And to this day, I can’t tell you what those messages said with that terrorist 109 times the morning of that attack

If it takes $3 million to wire the town, why wouldn't someone just bring a town online, then just keep expanding one town at a time?  I

I realize there would be an upfront expense, but it seems like the operating and implementation costs would get cheaper as they go.  The administration side wouldn't really grow much as the network grows...

7413 :: Apple CEO: We Will Take This iPhone Case to the Supreme Court
The general public is very misinformed about this issue. Many news stations are claiming that Apple has access to the San Bernadino terrorist's iPhone information, and that Apple is intentionally withholding that information from the FBI. That's a big misconception.
  
  

The real story: The FBI has asked Apple to develop a less secured version of iOS. The FBI ordered Apple to develop an iOS version that lacks critical security features that protect users' information. The FBI ordered Apple to develop this unsecured iOS, and to give it to the FBI to use. The unsecured iOS would allow the FBI to use a "brute force" attack on the iPhone, enabling the FBI to bypass the phone's passcode and see the contents on the device. Apple has complied with the FBI as much as they can, but they refuse to comply with the FBI's order to make an unsecured iOS, because doing so and putting it in the hands of the government would essentially create a "master key" to unlock iPhones. Apple feels strongly that user information is private and should not be available to anyone, including the government.

>The New York Times article suggests that there was some evidence of encryption software being used elsewhere. A witness reported seeing a terrorist with a laptop, and told the investigators that as the computer powered up, "she saw a line of gibberish across the screen: "It was bizarre—he was looking at a bunch of lines, like lines of code. There was no image, no Internet," she said." The New York Times writes: "Her description matches the look of certain encryption software, which ISIS claims to have used during the Paris attacks."

Seriously New York Times? Are you that fucking stupid or is this wilful malice? This whole paragraph just hurts my brain and will make normal people scared of tech savy people.

>But as many were quick to point out online, the witness probably wasn't looking at some encryption software in action, because such systems show the decrypted message, not the encrypted form. The former Ars Technica editor Julian Sanchez wrote on Twitter: "It's suggestive of a verbose boot. Using encryption looks like 'reading a message' because you decrypt it first.

This reminds me a lot of a military exercise back in the day that was meant to showcase American high-tech military prowess. The general playing the "bad guy / red team" used all kinds of low-tech methods to confound the "good guy / blue team's" reliance on surveillance tech.  He used things like light signals to launch aircraft (no radio) motorcycle couriers, and small boats with suicide bombers.  Within the first day, he managed to kick the shit out of the blue team and sink a bunch of vessels. This didn't bode well for the good guys, so they changed the rules. Look under the heading " Exercise Actions" to read more about it. They basically resurrected the blue team and forced the red team to follow a tightly choreographed script that assured the blue team's victory (like forcing him to turn on ground radar so it could be destroyed, etc). Basically this guy used low-tech, asymmetric tactics to defeat a technologically advanced enemy and won.  I believe he quit in disgust a short time later. It's a good read:

Two years ago our local phone company began installing fiber throughout the town.  I was sick of AT&T and their outrageously expensive 3 mbps internet.  For some reason my crazy wife wanted to call AT&T and bargain with them.  What she was told (and fell for) were lies that they could provide fiber optic internet (they do NOT have a local fiber network here) *and* lower our landline/internet bill.  Oh, they lowered our bill -- by putting our landline on VOiP and they "upgraded" the copper line internet to 6mbps and she signed the contract, which expired a year later and they doubled the bill.  They wanted us to pay $140.00/Mo for a Voip phone and 6mps internet. Ditched them and while we still only get 10mps internet, it costs just $40.00/Mo from the local company.

The last time an AT&T rep was at my door, they told me they just got fiber in my neighborhood. I thought they meant FTTH/gigapower, they even said they didn't have caps. After I did some digging I found their fiber meant up to 18mbps max with a 250GB cap/month. I even asked them specifically about a cap, and he said there wasn't one.

He gave me an estimate, and I told him i'll think about it.

Guess who shows up next week with a service turn-up form, AT&T. Not only that, the price they quoted was significantly lower than what I would be charged

They're so adamant about getting sales, they're willing to say anything including, forgetting there are caps, giving incorrect estimates on prices, leaving out install fees, agreement fees, and taxes on the bill.

Of course I didn't take up their offer. I guess i'm lucky to have 60/5 with no cap for $66/month

In many areas AT&T installed FTTH in new developments in U-Verse territories, even if they weren't affluent.  Why?  Because copper is regulated, fiber is not.  
  
These areas have traditionally been limited to normal U-Verse speeds though, most likely to keep the murmers down from people across the street who will never get FTTP.  
  
In these areas they merely need to flip a switch, so to speak, and Gb internet is turned on.  
  
Source: I was an AT&T U-Verse tech in 11-12 in a University town That had FTTP rolled out to a bunch of new developments, who could only get the same internet speeds as the normal U-Verse VDSL customers across the street.

Ford is actually charging a fee for licensing the patents, whereas Tesla made them available for free. 
It’s still a good initiative though; hopefully it will accelerate other manufacturers' adoption rate!
259
7364 :: Ford follows Tesla’s lead and opens all their electric vehicle patents
In all honestly, to anybody who understands how patents and licensing work, this is not some generous thing and not "opening" patents. It's basically telling everybody that Ford's business model now includes licensing their patents (for a fee) instead of *just* using them in house. It's an additional business model.

Remember, patents are already public information, and you can always negotiate to license them from the patent owner. The owner can always say no. Sometimes companies keep them for internal use only (until they expire) to keep competitors out. Sometimes they create mutual IP agreements with collaborators or even competitors to share IP. Sometimes they license into non-competing spaces.

All this announcement says is that they are open to licensing them out, for a fee.

Musk's announcement was similar but didn't mention anything about a fee. (However, he didn't exclude it.) You still need a patent owner's permission to use the patent, and legally speaking that means some sort of license to use it, until it expires of course.


67
7364 :: Ford follows Tesla’s lead and opens all their electric vehicle patents
Tesla didn't open all their electric vehicle patents. They said that anyone can use their patents and they won't sue unless they think you deserve to be sued. This is a useless promise.

And this also doesn't open them, this is an offer to *license* them.

'Ford says there will be a licensing fee.'

I have 2 questions. 

Do you think a driverless car will have some sort of ability to override itself to save the passengers life? For instance, someone could be drunk at night out for a joyride, speeding to their drunken little hearts content, let's say 60-70mph and they're coming up to an unexpected stop sign that you are currently at inside of the driverless car. Would the car sense the impending danger and slam on the gas and swerve out of the way to save your life? How smart are these things? 

Do you think using these cars as a taxi service that you can pay for using your phone/card/watch would possibly be in our future? Like the Johnny Cabs in Total Recall or something. 

IMHO driverless cars are really cool and I am excited to see what the future holds for them.

I wrote this to my Representative. I'm from Michigan and this absurd bill is backed by another Rep from my state, although from a different district. If anyone wants to take this and use it as a template to send to their own Rep I would be proud to have it used.

"I'm writing to inform you of my opposition to H.R. 2666 passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee. I simply don't understand why our representatives, who are supposed to be serving the best interests of their constituents, are against broadband rate regulation by the FCC. The United States lags far behind the rest of the developed world in broadband speed and prices, and not for lack of ability. Many of the ISPs in our country have become fat and greedy, looking solely at maximizing profits and essentially extorting their customers rather than innovating. A friend of mine recently visited Romania on a missions trip, and paid $7 a month for internet vastly superior to what is offered here. Romania is ranked 3rd in the world in internet connection speed! Yet if you asked most people on the street if they thought Romania even had internet they may say they don't.

For example, take a look at the areas that have been recently serviced by Google Fiber. Competing ISPs just happen to find more network capacity and lower their rates at the same time a real competitor rolls into town. The capacity is there, but absent any real competition ISPs don't feel the need to offer fair prices. The many local monopolies that exist are detrimental to the protection of consumers. In my area, there is only one broadband provider: Comcast. Sure, Frontier and AT&T may be available, but they don't offer comparable services. DSL is simply not on the same level as cable or fiber internet offerings. 

Our country needs innovation in how its ISPs are run, and protecting ISPs from the FCC is not the way to do it. The internet is no longer a luxury item, but has become as integral (if not more so) to our daily lives as the telephone. Why is it that consumers should be protected from price gouging in one utility but not another?  

I also find it suspicious that this bill is backed by Rep. Fred Upton - also of Michigan - and that the PAC that funds his campaign receives donations from the likes of AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon. These are all companies that would love to see this bill pass, and all companies that stand to benefit from a lack of price regulation in their industry. All I ask is that you, and other representatives, remember who it is that they are supposed to be representing and protecting.

Thank you."

Even if it facilitates piracy there it isn't inherently intended for piracy.  There are lots of people distributing content (e.g. Linux distros) that have the right to distribute the content that simply want to save money by either not maintaining an FTP server for their content or the at the very least minimizing the need for it by pushing off some of the content distribution to their users.

Of those that voted, **every** Republican voted for the bill. They were joined by only five Democrats. All of the Deomcrats who voted except those five voted against it.

Sounds like Google put up as good a fight as we can hope they would do. The disappointing part is how insultingly stupid the government's arguments are. When you have your own government arguing that citizen's private emails have "no reasonable expectation of privacy", you have to ask whose side they are on. And then most of their legal argument for sealing the order was as transparent as "but this will look terrible for us if it gets out!". And the judge bought it. Disgraceful.

The article says TASER Inc uses the AWS platform.

I do AWS as part of my (enterprise IT) job. Near-line (archival) storage costs about 1 cent per gig per month. Online storage costs about 3 cents.

So that 5T actually costs TASER about $1200 a year. But then there's the custom software to maintain everything. Make sure the requirements about evidence is followed. The humans to do all that work.

These numbers might sound high, but they're really not.

7279 :: Birmingham, Ala. has seen a 71% drop in citizen complaints and a 38% ...
Birmingham, Ala. has seen a 71% drop in citizen complaints and a 38% drop in use of force by officers since deploying body cameras two months ago, and costs are **low**.

Let's get real here:

1) Birmingham has a population of 230k, and spends $90m on its police force. So it spends $390 per person per year on the police. And this costs an additional what, $1m per year? (they referenced a $900k package that lasts for 5 years, but whatever, call it $1m per year). You're talking about a roughly 1% increase in costs, or $5 per citizen, for a 70% drop in citizen complaints and 40% drop in use of force. That's fucking cheap, like fucking ridiculously cheap. Can we please put that in the title instead of 'costs are huge'. 

2) And guess what, it's only going to get cheaper as the hardware for actual storage is becoming dirt cheap. They referenced 5 TB, well the retail price per terabyte is $30, that's a retail price for the hardware, you could store 5 TB on $150 worth of hardware. In 10 years it'd be about $10. Add abundant, industry grade storage instead and you're still looking at a few thousand bucks a year tops and that's extremely generous, and again, dropping every year. The big cost factor of course is management/software, and here too I expect price drops (they'll be way above market rate, it's government after all, but nothing near what it is today once more companies enter the market.

3) No business or organisation on the planet talks about costs and nothing but costs. Costs are incurred for a goal, and that goal has profits or cost-savings. Let's look at the financial benefits of cameras, too. Lawsuits that are avoided, trials that can be ended more quickly due to better evidence, as well as the above mentioned examples (drops in citizen complaints, use of force etc). Is it crazy to imagine that if you drop use of force by 40% and citizen complaints by 70%, finish trials faster and avoid lawsuits, that you may get a 1% cost saving? Well if so, the costs have already been compensated for by cost savings.

This really isn't the time to run clickbait articles that scare people into opposing one of the best modernisations of the police force we all depend on and will be dependant on for many, many years on the basis of marginal costs.

So, they bought 319 cameras for $180,000.  The cameras cost $564 each.  Then they're being charged almost $900,000 for 5TB of storage (or maybe it's 900k - 180k).

How do I explain this to my friends and family in a way that is actually meaningful?  How do I explain to them that encryption is extremely important to guarding their digital well-being?

It seems that it's one of those cases where people don't understand how the technology works so their immediate reaction is to either (a) run or (b) not give a shit.  When I try explaining things on a high-level, it seems like nobody understands how important it is.

As a programmer, I know exactly why it's so damn important. I just haven't been able to come up with a way that doesn't sound like, "Don't worry guys, slccsoccer28 is a programmer.  He takes these things a bit out of context".

Backdoors will render secure channels useless, information will be out in the open even more than is already the case** when criminals get to understand them and grey-ish hackers reveal them.

Backdoors will have to be put in by _someone_ right? Say goodbye to open-source encryption because those backdoors have to be kept secret. Proprietary encryption will solve that, but it'll increase the cost of every product that uses it.

My parents lived the "Eastern Block". They would whisper when talking about the bad shit that was happening to them. 1/10 people were informants, there were microphones into any fucking building. I swore I would leave my country so I cannot be affected by the echoes of that fear and paranoia. Now I live in Canada, it's a wonderful place that I really love. I hope this new police state, very similar in shape with the old communist dictatorships won't come so aggressively to Canada too. It looks like it's already too late for the US. 

First sign is when scared people defend the abuse, or censorship: "yes it's fine, it's for our own safety". It never is, truly. It's starts slowly, and very soon you'll "whisper" too, don't let it happen. 

Regular people would gather in front of their apartment buildings, and speak bad about the leadership with coded words like: "jerking off". They would go: "When I'm in my own house can I just jerk off in peace, without the secret police knowing about it, I just want to "jerk off" in my own house, it's not hurting anyone, but nobody can force me not to jerk off in my own home" 

Meeting new people was a real hassle, since you never know if they're working for the state or not, so a lot of double meaning stuff would be said to be sure you we're both on the same page. 
Some guy at my dad's factory (he was HR/payroll) stole some cement (everyone would steal from their place of work) and my dad got questioned because they believed he was in on it, they squeezed his fingers in the door and punched him a bit, this was light torture and he was happy he didn't end up with a professional torturer, the kind that does "ball stuff".

I'm sorta worried something like this will happen with me. Because some band has the same name as my online handle, that I've had before they were a thing, but I've been seeing them creep their way into Social Media stuff more and more lately, and I'm just waiting for the day when either they try to force me out of using my name, or do something like this and just take it over.

7202 :: Google bans ads for payday loans
I understand all the things that make payday loans bad, but if one needs $200 fast, who else is going to lend that person $200?

That' $20 isn't an interest payment.  It's a fee for service.

In my early days, I had a friend that was always 'short'.  After getting tired of lending money and waiting to get paid back over and over again, I finally charged him a 10% fee.  I used it as a clear signal to him that I was done with lending money to him.

Still borrowed money from me, and eventually we were no longer friends.

But of course, if you're at the point where you need to use a loan service, you're probably doing something wrong.

EDIT:  If I need $200 NOW, who is going to lend me that money?  If I don't get $200 NOW to pay the electricity bill so that I can work from home for the next 4 days, I'm going to lose $200 in income, so $20 is not a big deal to pay, but of course it's a slippery slope.

For all the naysayers out there, what is a non predatory alternative out there that ALREADY exists?

For those against payday loans, those who work who need a short-term loan but have no other avenue to get a loan outside of a pay loan, how do you suggest they gain access to funds?  Payday loans my have high interest rates, but part of that is due to the high default rate on these loans.  Something like half of those who get payday loans default on them.  How can a business sustain such a model without a high interest rate?

7165 :: Want fiber Internet? That’ll be $383,500, ISP tells farm owner. Good ...
If there aren't other potential customers on that route, the $42K is a reasonable price. Someone I know lives 1/2 mile off the power grid, and got estimates from both the power company and contractors in the $20K range for the 1/2 mile. Of course that included about a dozen poles, etc., while the fiber route is probably on existing poles. He chose to just go right to his own power system, for less money.
2342
7165 :: Want fiber Internet? That’ll be $383,500, ISP tells farm owner. Good ...
Do outside plant engineering for an electric utility who wholesales fiber and bandwidth.  $42,000 is a good price for this distance and so is the  $6,000 kicker for future customers.  I use network analytic tools in our GIS database to determine our chances in signing up new customers along a newly built route for someone like Verizon, US Cellular, Sprint, etc...  These carriers have deep pockets and can cover the upfront costs associated with rural fiber development.  Schools, libraries, other public utilities and municipalities will come along and request access in which case we can provide at a substantially lower price.  

I don't have $42,000, but if this guy has it I would pull the trigger.

A golf course not too far from him just got Verizon to put up a new tower, but his house is in the shadow of a hill from it. 

He's working on building an enclosure with power for a Cradlepoint that can see that tower and then running cable back to his house.

While I, obviously, don't think $380,000 is a reasonable estimate for laying fibre, I do have a similar experience that may be able to shed some light on *some* of the cost discrepancy.

In many cases, small companies are much more nimble and efficient than large companies.

Yes, economies of scale generally *reduce* prices... But *only* if the activity in question is able to be done on a massive scale... Say, laying fibre for a metro area.

This is a one-off job.  This means the company has to divert resources it would *otherwise* be using more productively to do something they wouldn't even consider profitable.

Small companies, meanwhile, have resources (such as trucks and spare cable) going *unused* that aren't generating ANY revenue.  In this case, any revenue is good revenue.

In my field, we routinely win contracts over much larger companies because we don't need to factor in opportunity cost in our bid.  In some cases, we bid a quarter of the cost or less. 

Like I said, not trying to justify the ludicrous price tag.  I'm just offering a *possible* explanation of why there would be such a discrepancy. 
57
7165 :: Want fiber Internet? That’ll be $383,500, ISP tells farm owner. Good ...
This whole thread makes my head hurt.  I own a ISP and we are about to take part in a 200 mile fiber build in northern Virginia.  

The average cost to run fiber on a pole is about 25k per mile.(this is using contractors because.. well everyone uses them and nobody staffs their own construction crews).. around here.  On top of this costs you also have pole attachment fee's which is defined by who owns the pole, if its a public utility its X dollars per year if its a CO-OP power company then you will get raped because they don't have to follow the communications act that sets these rates for public utility... re: net neutrality title 2 rules to be exact.  

Now you could possibly dig cheaper than to put stuff on a pole if you live in a sandy area where you could just rip through the ground and lay the conduit.. rocky areas or areas with red clay. not so easy.

 What people are failing to realize that most of the costs comes from permitting and design/construction.  Labor isn't that bad and materials is peanuts.. The bulk of the price also will come in as the last mile to the house.

/u/brp was somewhat accurate but thats more for longhaul rather than a last mile access.

Last mile you still have the following  

  * engineering to design the route/technical drawlings for permitting
  * permitting from the county
  * pole attachment agreements from the pole owners, or DOT permits for right of way digging
  * labor crew and bucket trucks or trench crews for the actual work
  * fiber vaults in the ground or enclosures on the line for splicing
  * restoration services, i.e grass etc after its dug up

PON is a bit different than a normal service, pon will simply allow you to fan off on average 32 devices on a strand of fiber. Most ISPs will dedicate a bundle of fiber to a neighborhood and bring it back to a pedestal or what we would call a "womp" which is a cabinet houses some electrical gear and some other network gear, maybe a PON switch or some dwdm gear and then get shipped off down the fiber to a central office.

7160 :: US anti-encryption law is so 'braindead' it will outlaw file compression
Like many of the laws proposed (and passed) by Congress, this is an assault on the rule of law.   
Laws are being passed that depend not on the words of the law, but on how they will be *interpreted* by law enforcement. File compression will **not** (in most cases) be outlawed, unless they feel like like it. They will (in most cases) choose to interpret the law as permitting file compression.  
However, what this means in practical terms is that (once again) you can't really know what the law is because it has become whatever the current whim of law enforcement is. Homeland Security's growing penchant for *secret* interpretation of the laws exacerbates the situation so that the only law is whatever the LEO's want it to be...(today).

7151 :: 76% of Netflix Subscribers Think Netflix Can Replace Traditional TV
A related study shows that 24% of Netflix subscribers are big sports fans.

*Edit: Posted this and came back to a blowed up inbox and some gold (thank you). I'm not talking about casual fans, or big fans of a single sport. I'm talking about big fans of several sports. I'm ~~fairly well versed in~~ aware of streaming services, and if I paid for all the hardware or streaming services needed to watch all the sports I'd like to (particularly MLB, NFL, & college football) I'd be spending about the same amount as I am for cable TV. I was a cord cutter for about 2 years. I went from paying a little over $100/month for cable + internet to paying about $60/month for only internet. It was a whopping $40ish in savings. I then subscribed to netflix, which cut my savings down to $30/month. Last I checked ESPN's streaming service was either $15-$20 ($20 if using Sling TV). Now my savings are down to $10 or $15...and I STILL don't have access to all the sports I want.

On top of all that, cable is MUCH easier and MUCH more reliable when it comes to sports. I'm glad that streaming services are becoming more prevalent, but unless there are options I'm not aware of it's no where close to replacing the value cable provides for sports.

7139 :: EFF: Publicly Funded Research Should Be Publicly Available
Doctor here. You can thank the bipartisan effort of Senators Birch Bayh (D-IN) Robert Dole (R-KS) that this is legal. In 1980, they introduced the Bayh-Dole Act which ["was followed by other bills promoting the commercialization of publicly funded research, a phenomenon soon exported worldwide."](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1306755)

This all started with a dispute over patents of a test to detect phenylketonuria (PKU) which was invented by Dr. Robert Guthrie in 1960. The article I linked goes into greater detail, but the Bayh-Dole act is really the pivotal moment which legalized the use of public funds for private gain. Interestingly, this Act also allowed universities to begin turning into for-profit research institutions instead of non-profit academic research centers.
88
7139 :: EFF: Publicly Funded Research Should Be Publicly Available
This bill only applies to grant money from federal agencies. While it's a good thing, the vast majority of research carried out by American academics is funded by their institutions. For public institutions, this means that a portion of a researcher's salary is paid to carry out research. This is why TT faculty at R1 schools teach only two classes a semester: because the other 50% of their time is supposed to go to research (and maybe 10% for service). If a large, state school hires an Assistant Prof. in *any* field, that person is literally being paid by the public to carry out research.

I'd like to see all of *that* publicly funded research also be open. However, the publishers stand in the way. In my field and in many others, we write articles for free, we edit journals for free, and the publishers charge inordinate subscription fees (thousands per year) to publish our free content. If we try to publish elsewhere, we don't get tenure.

7139 :: EFF: Publicly Funded Research Should Be Publicly Available
Academic scientist here. 

There is a conflict between the open sharing policy and high profile publications. In particular publications in Nature and Science magazines aren't free, but have the highest impact, and are also those talked about most often by the press. So this new rule by definition prevents truly ground breaking results from being published in journals with the highest impacts. The obvious solution would be to make those journals free, but they need to make money to continue to exist, so that'll never happen. 

While I agree with the principles of free use, I can't fathom how it will work.

I'm assuming that patenting counts as open publishing, right? I get the argument with regards to things that are published in expensive journals, but stuff that the researcher intends to publish through the patent system is another animal. It seems at 1st glance that if the public funded it, it should belong to everyone, but practically speaking, if there's commercial value and it's free to everyone, big corporations will effectively own it. If you want small startups to have a chance these days, you have to fund the work, let them patent it, and hope they can find the money for the lawyers and everything research grants don't cover in the steps between research and attracting investors.

The funny part of this is that Comcast and other cable companies also can  claim that their average wait time to speak to a customer service representative is under five minutes. In fact, it's in a lot of city ordinances that there are certain customer service standards that the cable (which is different from internet) companies must abide by. 

Now how does Comcast get away with claiming this? Because if you call up and just use the automated menu and hang up they count that as a zero minute wait time.

Yea, well I only was on the phone with Time Warner for 3 hours and I got them to NOT charge me a fee for them fucking up charging my card and not notifying me.

In all seriousness, it was a horrible experience. I did finally talk to the billing team at the tail end and she truly did hook me up. She waived the fees that shouldn't have been charged, and she even called me back after we hung up and put me on a promotion which took $15 off my monthly bill. I was shocked.

Regardless, I'll be switching to fiber the moment it becomes available. They already have it laid out all over my area, but it's just not available in my location quite yet for whatever reason.

Not making excuses for other ISP's but I used to install satellite TV and it's sometimes hard to hit those times.  
Let's say you have 5 jobs in your queue, well job one is listed as only being a troubleshooting call, you get there and find their line is completely wrecked and that 1 hour allocated troubleshoot just turned into a 2-4 hour reinstall but they don't really adjust your time and every other technician has an equally sized load so you can't ask someone to pick up your slack.  
With that being said, the key that I had to not pissing off customers when situations like this came up is proper communication. When I knew the job would take a lot longer I would call all other customers  when I first started the extra work and when I was leaving. Sure some don't want to get that phone call with me telling them I'll be 2-4 hours late but it at least will let them know they have X amount of hours before I'm there so they aren't potentially waiting around all day for me and instead have a smaller window of when to expect me.

7091 :: Dell ships laptops with rogue root CA, exactly like what happened wit...
Here's what I did to ameliorate the problem (I have a new XPS 15 that arrived 5 days ago that is infected - fuckers!). Essentially, I created a batch file to remove it and setup a scheduled task to run after each logon. Steps for those that need them:

--creating the batch file:

1. Open the cert manager and note the cert's serial number: follow OP's instructions to locate the cert -> double click the cert -> Details Tab -> serial number should be listed. copy down the hex string of characters as you see them.
2. Create new text file and save it with a .bat extension.
3. Insert the following command:

    certutil -delstore root "<cert serial number>"    

4. Save the file.

--creating the task to run it at logon:

5. Click open the start menu and type "Task", in the results should be "Task Scheduler", open it.
6. Follow the instructions [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-administrator-mode-shortcuts-without-uac-prompts-in-windows-vista/) to create a new task, with the following differences:
a. on the General tab, select "Run with highest privileges"
b. under triggers, where it says "Begin the task: ", select "At log on" from the drop-down.
7. on the Actions tab, click "new" and where it says "Program/script" browse to the .bat file you created above.
8. click Ok.
9. Test by shutting down and restarting (note: restart does not recreate the issue. You must shut down completely, then wait, then start your PC to fully recreate the test).

Notes: I got a bit paranoid about putting the actual cert serial number in this - I wasn't sure if I'd reveal something specific about my PC. If someone else is sure its safe to post, post your cert serial and I'll update these instructions if it actually matches my cert's serial.

Also, aside from the fact that we should not have to do this shit, **I'd really like to hear feedback on the drawbacks to this approach!**

7091 :: Dell ships laptops with rogue root CA, exactly like what happened wit...
This is likely for Dell support tools. But when you create a cert for internal use or tool use, you only distribute the public key portion. So people can verify it.

What Dell did here is ship the private key and installed the cert as a root cert. So anyone can use this dell root cert private to create signed certs for common domains that will look legit to most browsers. 

And since the cert is on a fuckton of laptops, an attacker can set up a fake banksite that mirrors the real site, then sign the cert with the dell root cert ( which dell was nice enough to include the private key for ), and since the dell cert is also installed as a root, the browser will trust that fake banksite.com is the real banksite.

The root cert alone isn't necessarily the issue. The fact Dell ships it preinstalled as a root cert and includes the private key is. Of course, even if Dell just properly shipped the root cert, they would have to properly protect and manage their private key ( which obviously they can't do! ). 

The proper way this should have been done ( unless windows doesn't allow it ), is to keep the private cert on disk somewhere, and only load it on demand and use when dell tools need to talk to dell servers. Most TLS/SSL libraries allow you to load an arbitrary cert and use it for communications. No need to put it permanently in the central trust store.

I suspect Dell farmed out their tool development, and whatever firm developed this read some tutorials and blindly followed them without thinking it through.

Actual document [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/19/us/20-foia-nsa.html). Cited paragraph (page 65):

> **Other authorities can satisfy certain foreign intelligence requirements that the PR/TT program was designed to meet.** The Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis (SPCMA), which SID implemented widely in late 2010, allows NSA to call-chain from, to, or through U.S. person selectors in Signals Intelligence collection obtained under a number of authorities. In addition, notwithstanding restrictions stemming from the FISC's recent concerns regarding upstream collection, FAA §702 has emerged as another critical source for collection of Internet communications of foreign terrorists. Thus, SPCMA and FAA §702 assist in the identification of terrorists communicating with individuals within the United States, which addresses one of the original reasons for establishing the PR/TT program in 2004.

The headline in the [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/records-show-email-analysis-continued-after-nsa-program-ended.html?_r=0) that Ars Technica cites is accurate, "File Says N.S.A. Found Way to Replace Email Program". PR/TT was a domestic email metadata program that was ended in December 2011, and this paragraph says that other authorities, "Satisfy the requirements it was designed to meet." Ars Technica interprets, "Satisfying the requirements," as, "Effective continuing [the program]." The "It's Official" headline is clearly misleading, because the only thing that is official is their not-terribly-charitable interpretation.

First off, everyone should read the actual document. For an organization that has no oversight or compliance, it's over 120 pages of oversight, which details their audit and review of internal NSA controls that protect the data of US persons. They give specific numbers for how many references to US person were found as having been collected incidentally (not to us, it's redacted; to the oversight overlords). On the whole, it shows a lot of compliance for things like RAS, limits on chaining, and minimization of information regarding US persons.

Next, Section 702 is overseas collection of overseas data, targeted at foreign persons. It would be frankly shocking if NSA were not doing this. What Ars Technica is concerned about is that the incidental collection on US persons could be large (the conspiracy theory version is that they're intentionally targeting queries that will bring back large quantities of incidental collection). They provide no evidence that it *is* large, so again, their headline is pretty grossly misleading. All this is really saying is that 702 collection is still happening (it would be negligence if it wasn't), and that NSA seems to be satisfied that they're able to investigate foreigners (when they are overseas) in the course of their terrorism investigations.

EDIT: Obligatory holy shit I've never gotten gold before! Thanks stranger!

The logic of "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" is completely useless as a defense when the government is already lying to us, they lied to even *establish* that power in the first place.

"The government isn't spying on all citizens - they told us they aren't."
"Well, it turns out they lied. It's been confirmed that they absolutely are.
"Oh. Well, they'll only use it for security, not abuse it for political purposes. They told us they wouldn't."

The fact that government officials flat out denied they were collecting data, only admitting it when forced to by a whistle blower, ***whom they gave treason status for informing american citizens what the government their taxes pay does without their knowledge***, should be a huge fucking red flag: our government is ALREADY corrupt and disloyal to it's citizens, the evidence is completely undeniable. Why in the fuck would you trust a confirmed corrupted government with what is possibly the most potentially oppressive power the world has ever seen - that of knowing EVERYONE'S whereabouts, communications, affiliations, etc. 

The willful ignorance of the sheep defending this nonesense is just infuriating.

I think that, as local and presidential politics go, economic equality is still the most "common ground" issue that can get others behind well-thinking canidates and policies, but really stuff like this, global warming, etc. will have HUGE world-changing consequences down the road. Just imagine some of the terrible regimes of the recent past, and imagine if they had the kind of power our government is currently building.

Best part of the article by far:

>So far, Bush has not proved himself to be particularly technologically adept during the presidential campaign. Earlier this year in an attempt to be more transparent, the brother of President George W. Bush published six Outlook files full of all of his unredacted correspondence. In the process, Jeb Bush created a trove of full names connected with personal e-mail addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, and even social security numbers.

7085 :: Verizon just blatantly betrayed net neutrality by excluding its video...
Here's a crazy idea Verizon. **Don't** be like the others. Provide a better option by giving sensible bandwidth limits (*say, 50gb/month to dissuade people from abusing their cellular data as replacements for home Internet, but still plenty to use our phones for streaming music and videos on the go*), offer phones **without** un-removable bloatware and don't try to push your own, sub-par services over others. With you're already great service/coverage I bet you could even raise your prices and you'd still be the good guys and customer would flock to you from other carriers.  

Sounds like a win for customers and Verizon to me.

Technicality ...
"All four defendants deny having had anything to do with the site since its reported sale to a Seychelles-based company called Reservella in 2006.

This is kind of great. Netflix is proof that people will be less inclined to pirate things if they are priced reasonably and easily accessible.

I misunderstood the title to mean they'd been acquitted of all charges, but this unfortunately only referred to a totally separate set of charges in Belgium. Our great heroes are still, sadly, held captive by the State.

7035 :: In a First, Judge Throws Out Evidence Obtained from FBI Malware
I realize this is probably going against what the majority of reddit users will think, but I'm not so sure I agree with the judge on this one.  Collection of IP addresses of users from a site that they're actually hosting doesn't sound like a warrantless search to me.  If you're hosting the server, which they were in this case, pulling the IPs is trivial and I don't think would actually count as a search since the users are accessing the server of their own volition.  Unless the FBI actually did something more than just log the IP addresses of everyone that connected to the server, I don't think they really did anything wrong here.  

Now, if the FBI used those IP addresses to remotely hack the user's computers without a warrant, that would constitute a warrantless search.  What I imagine they actually did was use the IP addresses to look up who the user was of those IP addresses at the time of access, then get warrants based on that for searches of the computers at the residences that the server was accessed from.  

So, am I missing something?  As a Sys Admin, collecting IP addresses from server logs is something that we do all the time and is completely trivial and could hardly be called a search since it's the users actually accessing MY server.  

EDIT: Apparently I missed that it was a server on TOR, which would require that the malware be downloaded onto the target's computer in order to backtrace the IP address.  In my defense however, that's never stated by the article.

7020 :: Reddit in uproar after staff sacking
I know this will probably be buried, and maybe no one noticed us when we were the reddit vendors, but this situation really mirrors the treatment of vendors/users/reddit employees when reddit shutdown the "reddit marketplace"

One day my wife and I were running a store that was paying a good portion of our income, my wife having quit her day job partially because of the income from the reddit marketplace and the next the store was gone. All the links to our store now redirected to a list of "reddit" merchandise like snoo plushies and stickers, with no mention of the store's closing. I had given most of our customers that address, and now had no way of contacting them. Stickers and business cards we had given our now redirected to a site selling reddit snoo merchandise. Reddit had not only shutdown the marketplace, but hijacked all the traffic to their own stores and pretended we never existed. Customers with existing orders were unable to contact us, and if for example, we had a problem with a customers order, we literally had no way to look it up or refund the client or anything, the entire store's backend was deleted without warning.

These stores used to be used primarily for the gift exchanges such as secret santa. Any posts we made anywhere to tell customers was instantly deleted as "self promotion". We were all only allowed to post in a single thread in another subreddit that's primarily for the vendors. One day our stores were being advertised all over reddit, the next we're not allowed to "self-promote" by even trying to contact our old customers, we were told it was a violation of the rules to contact customers by email, or use the phrase "reddit markplace" anywhere to tell people where we used to do business.

Reddit's management absolutely does not care about destroying communities, they have no concept of loyalty to people who grow these communities or rely on them. Even if they DID have to fire their own employees, they went out of their way to make sure that the reddit vendors business on reddit ended, and that secret santa just be stuff bought off amazon instead.

Also, stop gilding and giving gold to comments and posts if you are in protest, you’re just giving them money even though you disagree.

Also worth noting that ESPN has been building a very solid streaming network while all this is going on, meaning that eventually they're going to offer a web-only package. And if they sell it for anywhere near this $8 price point, their subscriber numbers will be through the roof.

KC resident here with Google Fiber. After a couple years, GF is basically everywhere here. Recently, TWC began running ads offering free upgrades to a 300mbps network and a better DVR box. Their previous top speed was 100mbps and cost somewhere between $80-$100 per month. (IIRC) Its funny how they can magically triple their network with no extensive construction or fees. 

Google Fiber is a pretty fantastic product. The bill never includes any extra fees, $122/month for cable and gigabit internet. In the 8 months Ive been a subscriber, Ive experienced 1 outage. Almost a full day with no internet. I called customer service and immediately got a message stating they were aware of the outage.

But I never understood why some rich entrepreneurial business didn't come up here and build a fuckload of fiber optic lines, sell them for slightly cheaper than Bell and Rogers, and have slightly better customer service than them (not hard), and it would put both of them out of business overnight or force them to change their shit.

>I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. 

>A few points: 
1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people. 

>Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person. 

>With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend.

All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad. 

>2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke. 

>3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. 

>Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police. 

>You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there. 

 > 4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him "fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?" 
"Sorry," he says. "I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore." There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail. 

  >Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons. 

  >You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors. 
 
  >This all happened in the country where I live. 

>  You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality. 

>Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not? 
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant "liberty and justice for all." You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety? 

>Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe? 

>I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen. 

>I actually get really upset when people say "I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything." People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

Something interesting I saw on Reddit about this argument a while ago

'One facet of this argument that goes largely undiscussed (and is something your friend may care about) is that it is bad for an imperfect government to be able to predict all crime. Some of the greatest steps forward in human history were only made possible by people being able to hide information from their government. If the church had access to Galileo's research journals and notes we could be hundreds of years behind in our scientific growth. If the government had unlimited access to the networks of civil dissidents blacks may have never fought off Jim Crow. If King George had perfect information America would never have been a country. There is no government on earth that is perfect, and therefore there is no government on earth that can act responsibly with unlimited access to information. A government is unlikely to be able to distinguish between a negative and positive disruption to it's social order and laws, and it therefore follows that an unlimited spying program can only hinder the next great social step forward. Don't fear the surveillance state because you might have something illegal, fear the surveillance state because it is a tremendous institutional barrier to meaningful societal progress.' - /u/Kim_Jung-Skill

Bellsouth(now owned by ATT) ran fiber all throughout this area 10-14 years ago and they won't turn it on. It kills me seeing the sign for fiber on my front yard and it not being used. So like most rural areas we're forced into Satellite and lets be real, the only thing you can do on it is surf the web in fear and hope you don't use up your tiny ass data cap.

The real problem is how major news outlets are reporting it. CNN, ABC World News, and our local news station all had reported how Apple is putting us at risk by protecting terrorists privacy, and placing their needs and rights above ours. 

The actual story of what happened was never reported. There was no mention of how our Government asked for what could basically be our undoing in terms of digital privacy. They have all made it seem like Apple and Tim Cook don't want to cooperate with the FBI. They did, and they had provided them with the data needed for the investigation. What they didn't do is fulfill their requests to make a virtual master key for their products so that our data is available o anyone and everyone who has access to it. 

As an apple customer, I'm very pleased with Tim's decision to oppose this kind of action. They are going toe to toe with one of the biggest and most powerful entities in the world, and it's certainly not easy to be in the position they are in now. I'm glad that my rights to privacy are respected by somebody, when I that they won't be by my own government.

For those who aren't aware, the US congress has just given Obama "Fast Track" authority. The TPP is on its way to make use of this "Fast Track", the passing of which makes it easier for congress to pass the TPP. This bill, the TPP, is expected to not only enhance the power of multi-national corporations at the expense of independent businesses and working individuals, but also promote similar restrictions on the freedom of the internet to those proposed by SOPA, as noted in the video by Julian Assange. People who want to speak out against this kind of legislation need to do so now as the bill is quickly gaining ground toward its being passed. Help speak out against it by spreading awareness and using the following assistance:

So i guess the option is for us to incorporate.  I'm sure if enough people got together we could form a "multi-national corporation".

We could gather enough funding to make a company that promotes tourism of areas with pure air quality and forests.  

Then we can sue our governments for inaction on climate change on the future profits of the lost tourism of areas that wont have good air quality and forests.

Your title implies that the other 24 chapters are only about regulating the internet. Quoting from the article:  

> Only five of the 29 chapters are about traditional trade. The others are about regulating the Internet and what Internet—Internet service providers have to collect information. They have to hand it over to companies under certain circumstances. It’s about regulating labor, what labor conditions can be applied, regulating, whether you can favor local industry, regulating the hospital healthcare system, privatization of hospitals. So, essentially, every aspect of the modern economy, even banking services, are in the TPP.

So it's about a lot more than just the internet.

I think we're going to find out every automaker is guilty of this. 

They mention Kia, but for that I don't think it was deliberate, I think it was poor engineering.

Kia happened in 2012 and in 2013 they had revised the EPA rating on the Moroney sticker. I bought a 2013. Guess what? It not only gets what they claimed in 2012, but exceeds it. Low mpgs for my car are about 36, high is 45+ and my average cycle is never less than 38. 

But there are people who got in the high 20's or low 30's on the same model the year before. $500 wasn't enough; they got lemons. Something was wrong in manufacturing or engineering. I don't know. 

It happens. My Dodge had a bad engine and got 18mpg. I put a new engine in it and it got 23mpg. Same car, 25% increase in fuel economy. 

Because of that, I won't be surprised if a lot of other manufacturers get caught up in this. It could be intentional cheating like VW and Mitsubishi or poor engineering like Hyundai and Chrysler.
69
6905 :: Mitsubishi: We've been cheating on fuel tests for 25 years

Because you won't! Not any sane, non-government person, anyway. Most likely the people responsible for pushing this bill know it has little to do with its official stated purpose and are using cybersecurity as the excuse because **a)** it's been in the news non-stop and the tough-on-crime mentality makes it that much easier, and **b)** people's eyes glaze over when you start talking about cyber security or other computer stuff, so there won't be much resistance because the masses will just think "oh, cybersecurity computer stuff?

Is this a new phenomenon? Every day we're hearing about the government getting large sums of data from companies, not one or two people. They've been pushing for backdoor access and are attempting to pass bills to make encryption illegal. It's like they're looking for people to go after. This is some minority report bullshit.

We need data ownership. If we owned our data and that which we produced the government would have to subpoena individuals directly for anything that isn't public data (unlike this post). Going after your personal data would be akin to personal testimony, and you could plead the 5th. As it stands, so much leaks out that you have no control over. It's essentially like you're loudly shouting everything you do publicly. How do we combat that? And, "Don't use technology" is not an answer.

I'd love to get a discussion going, as I'm sure there are numerous problems with it, but the basic idea seems along the right lines to me.

I once worked as a cab dispatcher.  Most states require cab companies to record and maintain records of cab rides going back 10 years, and to be able to call up that information in relatively short periods of time.  I'd often get calls from 911 dispatch asking for all pickups and destinations from a given area when they were looking for a suspect, and once some folks from the DA's office came over to comb through some paper records leftover from before the company had computerized- about 25 years of rides, all handwritten on 1x1.5'' cardboard slips, rubber banded together by dispatcher shift.  We were not required to retain records going back that far, but the only time they had gotten thrown out was when they needed more room for records, and the records room had taken over two entire auto bays in the garage around back of the building.

So, this doesn't surprise me at all.  Whoops, criminals, if you're looking to stay on the down low, /never/ call or hail a cab.

6878 :: Uber Transparency Report Reveals It Shared Data On 13 Million Users W...
This is Uber being misleading (no surprise there).

When companies like Reddit, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically everyone else except Uber release a transparency report they are reporting on data that was requested by *law enforcement*. In other words, subpoenas, warrants, and so on.

Uber received ~400 of those kind of requests for user data, and ~200 for driver data.

Uber's transparency report includes that, plus a bunch of other data they have to give to various government agencies that has nothing to do with crime or law enforcement.

For instance, legal, licensed transportation companies in California are required to provide certain rider data to the California Public Utilities Commission so that the PUC can determine whether or not the company is serving all kinds of passengers in any neighborhood or are discriminating against minorities or disabled people.

As part of a deal with the PUC to not be shut down in California for operating an illegal, unlicensed taxi service Uber agreed to also provide this data. (And then they tried to renege on their agreement, were fined $7.6 million dollars, and then provided the data).

At what point do we stop talking about legal fictions as being separate from the government?  They require governmental oversight, approval and just begin with, and I believe that corporations have become another branch of the government.

USPS needs Amazon.  The IRS needs Intuit.  The FBI needs Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft.  The US Military needs Eric Prince.

They have become extensions in every way for a government that instead of working for the people have begun to work solely for itself.

6854 :: AT&T fights to keep your internet as slow as possible
At&t just installed fiber on my street, so they've been sending around representatives to tell me why I should switch. I currently pay ~40/month for 16 down 2 up. I asked him what kind of speeds would be available through At&t, apparently 14 down 1 up is as good as they can do on this brand new fiber running in front of my house.

I was in town when this infrastructure was going in. EPB, the Electric Power Board has done an excellent job there. Affordable, reliable, and since they are the electric company too, they have an office where you can walk in and talk to people if you have trouble. 

Internet infrastructure should be treated as a public utility.

6854 :: AT&T fights to keep your internet as slow as possible
This is incorrect, AT&T is not fighting to keep broadband speeds slow, they are fighting to keep themselves as the only provider. The slow speeds are just due to them spending as little as humanly possible in their infrastructure, and due to no competition no need to do any more than the bare minimum.

6854 :: AT&T fights to keep your internet as slow as possible
This is all about AT&T wanting to keep profits as high as possible. By ensuring they are the only providers, they can keep speeds artificially low by not investing. It's the same battle Time Warner was fighting with Google Fiber in Kansas City. Google was just prepared to spend more on infrastructure and ensure higher speeds. Time Warner didn't need to offer faster service previously because they controlled the monopoly. Competition is crucial to forcing the hand of the monopolies.

6854 :: AT&T fights to keep your internet as slow as possible
Google Fiber announced they were coming to Nashville...

Suddenly AT&T starts installing fiber across the city. Comcast now offers 250mbit with 1gbit on the way. Both their offers are at competitive prices with Google Fiber. Comcast is even partially backing off their data cap here if you do a 2 year contract.

Funny how that works out eh? A little competition is all it takes. The broadband landscapes in Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, & Raleigh/Durham are dramatically different within two years of the Google Fiber announcement. In another 2 years they will be completely transformed. Competition is the solution to this problem in whatever form it shows up as.

I battled with AT&T for weeks. I am in college and I need faster internet to load videos I am assigned to watch and to sue my math program. 

At my dads house we get 156kb/s, literally third world  country internet.

At my moms house (across the street) she gets 256kb/s, which, albeit not a huge change, it surprisingly better than the prior. 

At first I just requested that we could somehow get up to 1mb/s, they said it was "impossible" then I requested that I at least get the same internet my mom is getting since we live on the same fucking road. They explained that since she got the service SOONER she got the better internet and there was no way for us to get the shiner turd that was 256kb/s internet.

I fucking hate AT&T, but I have no other option besides satellite internet with a 2GB data cap. Anyone have a similar problem?

6856 :: Broadband data caps are having their intended effect: punishing cord-...
If someone does not mind explaining: How did it actually happen, that the US ended up with only like what, 5 cable companies on a national scale plus a few local companies? Where did all the phone companies with (V)DSL go? Internet is so excessively expensive for you guys, it is sad. I pay 39.99€ for my 50 MBit VDSL (200 MBit with Vectoring coming soon to my area) which includes a flatrate for the telephone, as long as I call landlines and no mobile. With HD TV over VDSL (Telekom Entertain) it would cost 49.99€, but I don't have that booked. With both options I get unlimited data.

My friend in the US pays 120 USD for a 200 MBit line but has a data cap of 350 GB. His only option is Comcast since the other company in Tucson does not serve his area.

From a technical standpoint I can see why DSL might have a bad stand in the US since cities and settlements are so spread out and a lot of people could end up really away from the next DSLAM and only a few would get the speeds advertised, since the speed of DSL is actually dependent on the distance to the DSLAM. But isn't that an issue for cable internet too? Sorry, I am not savvy with cable and phone technology.

AT&T is actually doing the same thing. I have a 250GB cap which will be "generously upgraded" to 300 in May. We're cord cutters with Netflix and Hulu. I wasn't even aware we had a cap until we were notified of this upgrade. We were offered unlimited at $30 month EXTRA on top of the $50 we are already paying for a sorry 18mbps (fastest offered in my area of Southern California.) We were offered free unlimited if we signed up for 3 year contract with Direct TV. Hell to the highest no.

6856 :: Broadband data caps are having their intended effect: punishing cord-...
I have Comcast and I was told that I needed a basic cable package. It would be more expensive to just have cable internet... Right. I assume this is to entice me to add packages seeing as how basic cable sucks. I have wanted a few channels it sucks that you can't just pay per channel. The cable industry is like going to race day in a steam powered car. It will get you where you need to go but the platform is horribly outdated. I don't get the mind set of the stick when the carrot is so much more enticing.

It's really nasty. I've noticed that AT&T is offering unlimited cellular data to people who use their wired service (which is not available in my area). 

My (uncapped) Verizon FIOS service likes to say that my internet usage is "high" (175+ GB = "Power User, You use a lot of Internet") in order to upsell me to the next speed tier.

Electrical usage has peak and non-peak hours. Water and gas usage is metered, you pay for what you use, no monthly subscription games, just service. 

I could totally live without the bundled "triple play" of stuff in my $200/month Verizon FIOS bundle, but if I drop the land line or the TV subscriptions, the a la carte price shoots up. So I choose the value meal bundle price instead. 

It would be nice if internet utility were unbundled and sold in a more fair way.

Cars can easily be made to be unable to be remotely hacked; just put the stuff that is remotely connected to the internet on a separate circuit. If car manufacturers aren't doing that (some obviously aren't, as proven by reports of being able to remotely control the car), they obviously do not care the least bit about their cars being remotely hacked.

According to [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10640306/spacex-elon-musk-rocket-landing-success), Elon Musk has said that the Falcon 9 only requires $200,000 of fuel. If my (admittedly rough) calculations are correct, this is only about 5.5 transatlantic flights between New York and London on a 757, assuming $4,600/hour and 8 hours flight time. This is completely disregarding other factors like maintenance and wear-and-tear on the rocket, of course, but I think it's amazing how much more accessible the Falcon 9 just made space. This is a pivotal moment in history. It's what the assembly line did for automobiles. It's what the microprocessor did for computers. The sudden affordability of spaceflight will bring about a new renaissance of space technology, driven not by government entities, but by the private sector. They'll invest in new research and new infrastructure, and we as a society will all benefit because of it.

I served a few weeks in Florida a while back, over traffic citations. This system was used in our county. You could come in for a "visit", which you had to arrive super-early for, or you could pay upwards of $30 to skype from home. The cameras were 1998-level shitty, jumpy, glitchy as hell, and in a HORRIBLE position so that you could never really see the person you were talking to. In some of the few phone conversations I had with my family, (which they had to pay out the ass for,) they asked me if I wanted them to pay for it. I didn't want any more money coming into that system. If they gave me money for commissary, half of it was taken away and given to the prison right off the top, then I could pay an obscene amount of money for chips or cookies. (The Whole Shebang chips are amazing, though. A good way to get friends was to acquire those.) The new prison system keeps people inside as long as possible, and keeps their families penniless trying to give their loved ones some comfort. If there is a God, and he or she is just, then flames and misery await those who manage the prison business. But maybe us, too... we let these people come in with the promise of "lower taxes" and an underlying belief that inmates aren't people.

6839 :: Apple's Response To DOJ: Your Filing Is Full Of Blatantly Misleading ...
I have to say, I've never been very convinced by the "code is speech" argument, but I think there is a very compelling statement in here: 

>When Apple designed iOS 8, it consciously took a position on an issue of public importance.... The government disagrees with Apple’s position and asks this Court to compel Apple to write new code that reflects its own viewpoint—a viewpoint that is deeply offensive to Apple.

The code itself may or may not be free speech, but more generally with respect to the decision to sell a product with a particular set of capabilities and security - Apple could have spent their time and money building all kinds of things, and they chose to build this product. Compelling them to build a product which is contrary to what they believe in, to me seems like exactly like the kind of compelled speech the First Amendment protects against. Certainly if citizens united told us money is free speech, and businesses are people, then a company choosing to spend its money building a particular product ought to be seen as exercising free speech, and compelling them to do otherwise as a First Amendment violation.

I just testified against two federal agents (Border Patrol) for stealing from me.  In a bogus raid on 3 of my properties, while "seizing" property from me, 2 agents saw it fit to start putting my stuff in their cars....and texting a State Trooper about it.  The Border Patrol agents were found guilty of felony larceny, and the State Trooper will start his trial soon.

People with badges should be held to a high standard of moral accountability in my humble opinion.

Data throttling is against the new net neutrality laws, and they can be fined for it.

It saddens and frightens me that there are so many people in this country who do not know enough about technology to realize this:

If this were about cracking the phone, then the FBI could simply give the phone to Apple and tell Apple to give it back to them after it's been unlocked.  But they haven't.  Instead they have asked Apple to write a program and *give it to them* so that they can crack the phone themselves. They want a master key and they have every intention of using whatever Apple has been ordered to write for them on every single phone they get their hands on. I'm not technologically illiterate, and I assume the majority of people on this site are not either, but there are a lot of people in this country who are so technologically illiterate that they can't see through this BS... and it's not just sad; it's dangerous.

Just wait until a few weeks from now when I deploy Windows 10 while it's still free ;)

EDIT: Just wanted to proactively correct myself. I mentioned in a few places in the sub-comments that I used Enterprise edition of 7 and in others I stated I used Professional. All licenses are 7 Pro, with no Enterprise editions. Apologies for my mix up, however I figured this would be better than editing a whole bunch of sub-comments.

I know some of the older people I help out with computers, their reasoning is:

1. Their outdated computer cannot upgrade to anything else.
2. All they hear are people griping that Windows 7 sucks, Windows 8 sucks, and Windows 10 sucks. So they refuse to buy a new computer.
3. They know Windows XP, they have had to use it for 10+ years, so they are worried that the newer Windows OS's will cause them to have to relearn how to do certain things. 

The main issue is they never hear anything good about newer OS's, so it scares them to want to upgrade to something that may not properly work.

6771 :: Mitsubishi admits cheating fuel efficiency tests
The models they're talking about are Japan/Asia editions. 

In Japan, cars with engines smaller than a certain size get a different license plate (yellow plate) and are taxed at much lower rates. Some of these cars have engines that are 0.6 L displacement or so. Not sure of the exact cutoff size for this class of vehicles, but it's probably anything less than 1 Liter size. They pay less money when using toll roads as well. 

My car has a 1.4 liter engine and it's extremely fuel efficient. It's got the normal white color plate. I've driven a car with a yellow plate and it didn't really seem like it saved much on gasoline. It was a Terrios Kid, by Daihatsu. I can see why the manufacturers would want to list high fuel efficiency, when competing for a market where a bigger engine sized car might get similar mileage. I'm much happier driving a more powerful car that gets nearly the same fuel economy as these micro cars. These mini cars are easier to park though, lol.

6757 :: Sunny Nevada Just Killed The Solar Industry With 40% Tax Hike, Derail...
I am a solar owner in NV.  I install solar in NV.  I was at the last PUC meeting.  I am getting totally fucked by this and will have to move.  Here are the main issues.

1  NV Energy paid people to install solar.  They needed it at the time to satisfy the mandated amount of renewable energy they needed.  They told us it was a good idea and gave us checks and told us how much we would save.

2  They have decided that they don't need any more solar so they were going to change the rules going forward, but they decided to change it for everyone, even existing systems.

3  They created a bunch of false costs to justify the new numbers.  They ignored the survey they performed in 2014 that found that there was a 36 million dollar savings to non-solar users from their neighbors having solar, and instead referenced nothing.

4  Now they made it so the solar (that they paid you to install) will never cover the costs.  They did this by creating both higher monthly service charges ($15 increasing to $38) and crediting people less for energy fed into the grid (when the system is making more power than is being used at the time).

5 And they are still lying about this on their website.  Here is a link to some correct math  http://newnvelectricrate.com/lets-look-at-the-numbers-given-by-nv-energy/

When I put my system in the calculator, in 2020 my $15,000 3.5kw system will save me $120 a year.  The payback is never going to happen.  Now, when I was incentivized to do this by the people who are changing the rules with no warning, do you think that is fair?

>Adding insult to injury, they made the rate changes retroactive


How is something like retroactive rate hikes even legal? I *already* fucking bought it, how do I owe you more money because the price was changed afterwards??

edit: I/we appear to have been misled in this case, the article is misusing 'retroactive' as it would generally apply to something like a "retroactive rate change", and actually just means that everyone has to pay the new higher rates going forward. No one is having rate hikes apply to anything already paid. (thanks to several people for explaining this more clearly)

Imagine if they didnt have to fight over water to make power?  There have been disputes for years over the water and they don't want people using solar? What could possibly be the reason except for unchecked greed?  Very disappointing Nevada.

6747 :: Comcast’s data caps are ‘just low enough to punish streaming’
Clearly that was the goal all along.  
  
Luckily my region is not capped. If they ever decide to begin capping here, I wonder if that change to the service agreement enables me to terminate the contract?

6747 :: Comcast’s data caps are ‘just low enough to punish streaming’
When i was getting 1Mbps service from Comcast nearly 10 years ago my cap was 250GB. Today i have 75Mbps service and my cap is 300GB. Fucking assholes.

6747 :: Comcast’s data caps are ‘just low enough to punish streaming’
We need to start an antitrust campaign to split up cable providers into separate cable TV, and separate internet companies. There is a clear conflict of interest between providing cable TV service, and internet service. One company that has a local monopoly cannot be allowed to do both, and Comcast's streaming-punishing data caps are a crystal clear example of why.
86
6747 :: Comcast’s data caps are ‘just low enough to punish streaming’
And the worst part is I'm most places you've not any choice on providers. Or if you do is a giant douche, or a shit sandwich. The way the industry is regulated flies in the face of every free market idea that our leaders preach. 

The very idea that a company like Google, BY LAW can't come into many cities and build out their own network is anti competitive, yet somehow perfectly ok.

6747 :: Comcast’s data caps are ‘just low enough to punish streaming’
the only way this will be fixed is if Comcast splits its cable and internet service apart. Comcast inherently has a conflict of interest in providing internet AND a cable service that competes with cord cutting service providers like Netflix and Youtube. I wonder how often "data caps" are breeched when a user that has Comcast and only streams Hulu (a company Comcast owns) occurs.

Normally I brag in bandwidth threads about my 100up/100down connection for $58 unlimited. Or $70 for Gigabit if you want it. But not now. I'll just give a couple of bulletpoints on how it happened.

In Chattanooga, TN

The power company is EPB (Electric Power Board)

EPB installed a smart grid to monitor power and minimize outages

This was installed with the help of bonds and grants

There was enough bandwidth leftover to offer to customers

Comcast sued claiming unfair to compete with subsidized utilities

EPB said Comcast rates would go up on the poles they operate on

Comcast dropped the lawsuit


I'm sure Comcast will do all they can do block things like this in the future, but it seems to me the power lies with the power company...so to speak. That is where the change needs to start. The multinational ISP still must rely on the power company no matter what. The power company is already in your town...no need to move in. 

Trust me, I lived for years with Cox Cable in Baton Rouge, LA. I am used to the $55 3mb, 1.5 upload speed. I did it for a dozen years. But now, I am in heaven. When I do cut cable, I will bump up to the gigabit internet. I have been upgrading hardware over the last couple months. Gigabit internet, unlimited, $70/ month. Fucking amazing.

It didn't start out this way...when I got here in 2013, Gigabit was $300/ month, then it went to $70. They just announced 10 Gbit internet for the entire 600 sq. mi. service area two weeks ago. It is $300/ month...for now. While seemingly no one needs 10 Gbit, nor has the hardware to run it, it's nice to know I live in a place where they are pushing for what's right and not what 'maximizes shareholder value'.


[Welcome to the future](http://www.thegigtank.com/gig-city)

ETA: And when I call for service the two times I have needed, I talk to a person on 10th St./ M L King Blvd downtown Chattanooga...not hundreds or thousands of miles away. In the grand scheme of things it is keeping my wife and I from considering moving outside of the service area even though she commutes to North GA for work and we may GA income tax.

An area they kind of gloss over (rightfully so because it isn't the focus of the article) that I am extremely interested in is identification of plants by the shape of their leaves.

My dad has been talking about an app that he would be able to take on hikes to identify the trees and plants that he comes across.

Everything we had searched on the topic seemed to require a human element to distinguish features and essentially filter a huge database of species that are indexed/keyworded with these features.

Does anyone have information about what kind of 'computer vision' these use? Is it something that we may see in a camera-based app?

**EDIT: Thank you for the responses so far. I understand that the task this specific robot needs to complete is much simpler because it has very tight bounds/restrictions, but I am curious how scalable it is to the problem I described. Or maybe, as an intermediate step, a smaller problem of being able to identify a known subset based on a specific location to distinguish, for example, between plants that are safe or unsafe to touch/eat.**

Farmer here. You'll still need pesticides for insect control, and as far as potential harm toward humans, you're more likely to find an insecticide that's dangerous to humans since the mode of action is to kill an animal, rather than a plant.

Also, we'll still need fungicides to help control mold and fungus issues.

Edit: A bunch of you are suggesting robots to kill bugs. Aphids in soybeans are about the size of a dot on a sheet of paper, and if you make some nano technology that can take them out, I'm all for it. But right now it's most economical to do a $12/acre spraying when there's 250 bugs per plant on roughly 80% of the field to save yield.

**Video** of a similarly prototyped robot with a greater clearance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Aq6qVQOkw - apparently has articulating wheeled legs, so it's capable of dealing with variable furrows.

This version of the robot is modular (technicians install some kind of an add-on at 0:45. It's a bit confusing because the housing looks farm-grade, but the add-on is engineering prototype quality (built with v-slot rails).  The article looks like an earlier prototype ([larger pic](http://assets.fwi.co.uk/Bonirob-robot.jpg)). So, they're apparently breaking the problem down into components, which is an encouraging sign that they're taking this task seriously.  I want to say the video is a second generation robot by comparison with interchangeable task modules.

At the 1:30 mark you can see some kind of a rod moving, though I think it's a soil moisture detector since it's going very slowly and has wiring leading down to what could be an electrode. The module they're testing is probably as experimental as the plucker/pusher the article talks about, but doesn't actually show.

Despite having made a well designed robot, they're probably still very much focusing on the enormous computational challenges needed for deep learning the environment, but this article picked one 'what-if' feature, and ran with it.

At work right now, so I can't really comment. But I work for a jail phone company and would love to spill some dirty beans on this matter. If anyone sees this comment and wants me to share let me know. 

EDIT TIME: (more like update)

OK, for the sake of not being fired I wont give out names, but here it is.

I work for company that deals in providing call services to smaller jails.  In my time with this company, (over 6 years now), I have come across practices that make me sick.  I haven worked on contracts, installs, and even some ground level customer interactions, (the actual people paying for these calls).  I do mostly web design and other tech related things now, but I have had my share of time in all aspects of the company.  

Now right off the bat, let me say this.  There are a lot of misconceptions and often the real devils in the system are left in the shadows while others take the hits for their bullshit.  


________________________________

A. The States do set the prices for the calls, but many of the companies that provide the services charge a "admin" fee for using the service.  This can range from $5.50 in some companies to $10.00 for others.  Here are some of the other services aside from the company I work for that I have come across.  Globatel, City Tele-Coin, and Securus to name a few.  All of them work a fee for anything that they can into the service.  This makes a $4.00 call jump to $15.00 for many people.  That's only one example too, the range is all over the place for some states.  Some places even charge you to refund your money, up to $5.00 for some companies!  Look them up and see for yourself.


________________________________


B.  The money for these calls does indeed go to help inmates in many jails.  You think you pay for rehabilitation with your tax money?  Think again.  Most sheriffs are either strained for funds or due to overflow of inmates, or their own greed.  Many of them do care about the people in jail and even if you dont know it, go out of their way to ensure they have access to better books, education, and even religious meetings (even if the inmates don't want it).  However there are some true to life assholes that would rather pad the bill saying that the higher cost of calls goes to inmates food services, but in reality they are off golfing and having high priced fun nights while the inmates eat some of the worst sop you could think of it.  The people that need to talk about it dont as they get to take part in it.  Again, many of the staffs I have come across were some real upstanding women and men that deal with a shit storm and smile, so do remember those fine folks.  But know that the Boss Hog asses are real and people do suffer for it.


________________________________


C.  The jail can make money from inmates!  Yes, the overcrowded areas can pay off the smaller jails to take their human loads.  This has led to inmates staying in the system far longer than they need to.  Some of them get carted around the system with a price tag on them as the aforementioned assholes smile and collect the bill.  This works hand in hand with the way the phone companies do business too, See the next point below.


________________________________

D.  The jails barter their contracts to the jails with bonus money in the form of free computers equipment, more shares of the phone revenue, or even straight up money drops which take the form of something less noticeable, (think $1500 for a damn chair or mystery PC that never shows up).  This can mean that company that is providing a cheaper alternative for the area can be ousted at the end of a contract for an offer that just is all that more shiny.  I have seen calls from our company go from $2.45 a call to $18.95 a call after a new company had a particularly great lobster dinner with the Sheriff.  



________________________________


F.  As for other matters of cost, calls are cheap as hell.  Mostly SIP calls, that's digital! While the strain is OK, there are issues that can cause problems, but the majority of the time, this is a very easy thing to manage when done right.  Yeah, data storage can be expensive, but that's expected and dealt with just as well.  The real cost issue is the security and monitoring options. Many of these are custom built into the jail's environment and dev cost can shoot up depending on the builds. Others who know about this know that it can be done cheaper, but that also depends on the company.  These systems can save lives.  I have seen more than a few cases where a person has been saved or found innocent by this.  So there is a real cause for some of those fees implemented.     



________________________________

TL:DR

There are some fucked up practices in the inmate phone industry due to assholes that like to profit off the inmates turning corrections into an industry of human cattle.

Its not everyone, by a long shot, but it exist.  Why are more people not mad about this?  Do you go out of your way for an inmate?  Do you even know about half of this in the first place?  No?  There you go!

Also as a side note, take it easy on the people who do the grunt work in these companies.  Often times they can relate so much more than you think, but they need to feed their kids too.  Take your anger to where it really needs to be, the ones making it so that the system remains in profit goals rather than correctional goals.

On a final note to this long posting, remember that you are reading the text of someone you have never met.  You dont know me, you have no reason to trust me, and you can be sure that I wont try and verify everything as I would be fired Soooooo very quickly.  Just take it at my stranger's word.  Its real.  

But do one better...find out for yourself.

6727 :: Microsoft drops unlimited OneDrive storage after people use it for un...
This is so much bigger than the title suggests. MS is also dropping free OneDrive storage from 15GB + 15GB camera roll down to just 5GB. It's also downgrading it's existing 100GB for $1.99 option to only 50GB for $1.99 (yes, that's the same price). 

It's a pure downgrade across the board. Nothing is gained at all by the consumer. Amazing business practice.

The real story here is 15GB to 5GB and no camera roll. That affects everyone greatly. If they wanna say "whoops, we meant 'a lot' not 'unlimited'", then fine. But now they're not competitive.

I wish companies would stop saying stuff is unlimited and then a. making it hard to use it (throttling) or b. taking it away when it gets used for the reason people even signed up for it in the first place.

Home broadband data caps are extortion. It's just another way for ISPs to cut down on streaming entertainment without implicitly violating net neutrality. This is my biggest problem. I can't stand that my ISP can send me a 3 strikes letter and tell me what I torrented, but can't provide me with an itemized receipt of my data usage. 

Edit: I know that caps aren't against Net Neutrality. My point is that they are sneakily getting around not being able to throttle video streaming by having ridiculous caps in place to harm consumers that don't want to buy into their crap.

The only way we're going to fix this is to take away the source of the problem: monopoly / oligopoly service providers.

Since there's infrastructure involved and new providers have an enormous battle to break into the space, it should probably just become a regulated public utility.

Isn't the MPAA just a leech to the integrity of the film industry?  They control what can actually make it to viewers, and they've spent the better part of the last 15 years finding new ways to attack consumers.    This is not some government agency- it's an association that movie studios choose (forcefully) to be a part of.  This old geezer has been past its prime for a long long time.

Over 20 years ago while doing research I learned of a landmark case before the Supreme Court.
A man had subscribed to magazines, and each time he added some useless info to his address in order to see if his info was being sold (Apt. Z, Department 1095, a typo in his last name, etc.)

He started getting junk mail and was able to tell that a certain company had sold his information so he sued.

He lost. The Supreme Court ruled that his personal information was not "a thing of value" and therefore he did not have a right to it or to prevent its sale.

Think about that. His information has supposedly NO VALUE, which is why there's an entire massive industry that has the legal right to SELL his information without his permission. Because it's worthless.

That logic is what has led to all of these companies being able to compile and sell your private profile information and make billions doing it.

Because it "has no value."

Not an unexpected evolution but pretty fantastic. Bluetooth means you can now hook up keyboard and mouse to it wirelessly, and wlan means no more having to wire up Ethernet. Literally, this thing needs just power and that's it to be useful. Well... that and an HDMI cable.

This is a new incredible feat from The Raspberry Pi foundation, and I'm impressed by the modest media coverage there's been here and there.

TL;DR- The algorithm is the same as it's always been, increasing numbers of users who only upvote front page content keep stuff on the front page longer. They're working on a new algorithm that gives new posts more weight per upvote to overtake older front page content.

6644 :: Reddit Admits Its Front Page Is Broken, Is Working on an Entirely New...
Reddit also needs to modify its Moderator policies. /r/worldnews has been taken over by agenda driven hacks. Who are systematically doing a hit job and banning individuals who they perceive as a source of disagreement. This is really dangerous and something needs to be done about it. 


1283

223
6644 :: Reddit Admits Its Front Page Is Broken, Is Working on an Entirely New...
I'd go a step further, and also rethink which subreddits should be on the front page. I know reddit changes the default subreddits every once in a while, and I think it's overdue at this point. Subreddits like r/tifu, r/showerthoughts, and r/aww are pretty much mindless filler. I'm not saying that the front page should be nothing but hard hitting news stories, but if I was someone looking at the site for the first time, I would assume that reddit was comprised of about 95% fluff, and nothing particularly interesting or topical. I also like to browse r/all sometimes to find new interests, etc. and it seems like it's dominated by r/blackpeopletwitter, r/funny, and r/leagueoflegends. Maybe an algorithm that only allows a set number of posts for each subreddit to reach the front page or something like that. Granted, I'm probably a good decade older than the average person on reddit, but I still feel like a lot of these subreddits are overexposed. You would think that about 60% of the world's population plays League of Legends from the amount of posts that get upvoted to the top of r/all every day.
113
6644 :: Reddit Admits Its Front Page Is Broken, Is Working on an Entirely New...

This is so infuriating. It's like a bunch of children throwing a tantrum because they were told to eat their vegetables before their dessert. The ISPs would survive quite comfortably with net neutrality, but, since it won't be the same monopolistic control that they are used to, they will do everything they can to try and trick the country into fighting against their best interests. It's disgusting.

So many times we take things that are running smoothly for granted, not knowing how bad it could get otherwise. Wheeler, defending net neutrality over and over again, has so often heard all of this shaming, and after title 2 was passed, no positive feedback. The public agrees with him, but does so silently.

We should send Tom Wheeler our gratitude for defending net neutrality against this corrupt and inept congress. Tons of thank you notes, solidarity declarations, and other forms of letting him know that we value his work are something this man greatly deserves. Plus, well, perhaps this would give him additional motivation and energy to go on.

In 1948, this was an opinion stated by a Justice of the Supreme Court, on the case United States V. Columbia Steel Co.:

"We have here the problem of bigness. Its lesson should by now have been burned into our memory ... The Curse of Bigness shows how size can become a menace--both industrial and social. It can be an industrial menace because it creates gross inequalities against existing or putative competitors. It can be a social menace...In final analysis, size in steel is the measure of the power of a handful of men over our economy...***The philosophy of the Sherman Act is that it should not exist...Industrial power should be decentralized. It should be scattered into many hands so that the fortunes of the people will not be dependent on the whim or caprice, the political prejudices, the emotional stability of a few self-appointed men...That is the philosophy and the command of the Sherman Act. It is founded on a theory of hostility to the concentration in private hands of power so great that only a government of the people should have it.***"

America was far more liberal in some ways in the first half of the 1900s than it is now, in the first half of the 2000s. We have a significant amount of laws on the books created and enforced by people who looked forward and said "This should never happen again!"...and now we sit around with a government of people that ignore these laws and the past, thinking "Man, how did this ever happen?!"

We already have that for personal information. A warrant does not compel a person to testify against themselves.

Computers, tablets, and smartphones blur that boundary a bit, as some of their uses feel to us more as extension of ourselves and our personal memories. If I keep something very private on my phone, it's less protected than it would be in my brain, perhaps. 

But with the use of encryption, I've made a decision that the information there should be known only to me.

What makes such a case fundamentally different from something I keep directly in my brain, under Fourth Amendment analysis?

What if, instead of a phone, I used a module that interfaces directly with my brain at the neural level?

My concern is not so much about the piracy bit, but this forces ISP to monitor traffic on my connection.  It is not legal for the phone company to listen to my phone conversations, nor should it be legal for my ISP, unless there is a court ordered wire tap for law enforcement.  This strikes to the heart of privacy concerns.  The ISP now will monitor everything you do online, in the name of piracy controls.  It is not hard to see that that will stretch into selling the data collected to pay for the monitoring.  More data about all of us given away without any ability for us to control who gets data about us or how it is used.

Yes, their "big thing" is bringing online rights and technological issues to parliament so that the people in charge actually understand how the modern world works and more importantly *should work*, but they do put some effort into their other policies too...

The pirate party is simply working for the people. 

That is why they are getting all these votes. 

The other parties are obviously only working for the elite, its plain to see. None of their actions help the people.

I spent three years at Amazon. The stock was nice. I worked with some great people. To say that the job was stressful isn't an adequate description of the pressure under which I worked. Every day, we were expected to do more with less and were constantly compared to people in Third World countries who cost less than we did. The day I left, I cried tears of joy. I actually get to spend time with my family now. I'm also pursuing teaching. When I leave this planet, I don't want my contribution to be increased shareholder value.

Amazon is fast going to have the same problems McDonald's has.  Recall, Micky D's was/is the largest employer of millennials, and now they're baffled why millennials don't want to eat there.  At this point everybody has either worked there or knows someone who has, and they have no intention of giving their money to a company that treated them and their friends like shit.  So that is Amazon's future.  As more and more Xers and millennials are fed up with being treated like garbage at work, we are refusing to give out hard earned money to those businesses that do so.  Amazon is on the wrong side of history and the sociopath CEO who thinks he should own every second of his employees day as it they were slaves is too busy to notice that slaves revolt.  And the buying public treats slave owners like they should be treated, shunned like inhuman psychopaths ought to be when exploiting people for profit.  It's disgusting and morally reprehensible.

I have doubts that the government doesn't already have the means to break in to this one phone but it's an expensive (super computers and highly paid NSA people) process. They would rather use this as a precedent to break encrytpion. They have been beat up in several congressional hearings because they could not name a time that encryption hindered an investigation. A few months later the perfect case pops up and they want to use it. 

The should already have cell tower pings, sms records, call record, mobile data history and everything else they are claiming they want off the phone.

FBI is playing Chess, while the American public at large is stuck on checkers. 

Apple, along with other tech companies, thankfully don't have time to play with the FBI.

Think about it....imagine the process to this point. The FBI probably asked Apple, then probably begged Apple, then probably tried to slide it favors, then tried to threaten....

There's companies who "play ball" with the FBI easily (AT&T) in which they'll allow the wire tap, or rat out a customer. And it'll get sold to us that they're just "protecting" us. And our simplistic media will act as if nothing inherently wrong just occurred. 

Apple is protecting its customers by refusing to even sit at the table and pick up the chess pieces seemingly. I love it.

South Korea used to have this. Before smart phones there was a standard charger that fit every phone. It was super convenient. You could walk into a bar or restaurant, or even convenience stores and they'd charge your phone for you.

6558 :: Switzerland has ruled on a single charger format for mobile telephones
This simply mean that an adapter (and/or cable) will be provided so you can plug your phone into one end of the adapter and then plug the adapter (perhaps with voltage/current circuitry) into the wall transformer.

You'll still get the original "wall wart" but the adapter will be included for those sold in Switzerland.

They've simply added one more device to be sold... and raised the cost of the original devices.

Those reservations **can** be explained as easily as "we don't want anyone to sue us because they got approved to a 'live story' and they were seen worldwide".

If you don't know what live stories are:
>Live Stories are a curated stream of user submitted Snaps from various locations and events. Users who have their location services on at the same event location will be given the option to contribute Snaps to the Live Story. The end result is a Story told from a community perspective with lots of different points view.

Basically if your city gets featured in a live story, you can send snaps to Snapchat and they will choose good ones to show to people around the world. Some grumpy user could sue Snapchat for a lot of money because they didn't give explicit rights to Snapchat for profiting off of their submission. "Profiting" is speculation on my behalf since I am not 100% sure organizations can buy these "stories" to advertise their event, but it would make sense and is a good source of income. So because Snapchat can profit from your face being shown in the videos you have to give explicit confirmation that you approve of that, or don't use the app altogether.

I could be wrong, but I don't see how Snapchat would profit from an endless stream of boring selfies and inside jokes they have no idea of filling their servers. It sounds like to me that they are covering their asses saying "the photos aren't permanently deleted" because again some grumpy user can sue them because he or she somehow or another was able to access the photos.

**Edit:** *When you press "send" the picture is in the hands of Snapchat and their servers, and not yours. It sits on their servers until the recipient opens it. If it is to a live story when you press "send" it can be used to gain profit and it is on Snapchats servers until the live story ends. Again it is out of your hands.*

*No service asks you "hey can we put this piece of data on our servers?" every single time you have to send data back and forth. It is much easier to sign an agreement before you use the app so you don't have to press agree all the time.*

The actual data coming from the CERN detectors is so huge that 95% of 600 million collisions/second that occur when operating is thrown away by use of "triggers", done in just 4 millionths of a second. Of the 5% left, that still adds up to 30 Petabytes of data per year that is kept. This data trove is so large that no one site can hold it, so it is stored over several dozen university sites around the world. The data is then analyzed for further study.

ITT: People who didn't read the article.  Admittedly though, the headline is terrible and implies something completely different from what the article text says.

_Because_ they changed the password, the recovery mechanisms for the encrypted phone that would have existed no longer work.  Specifically, they could have triggered another iCloud backup, which they then could have retrieved without a backdoor.

Do we know exactly why the FBI is even seeking full access to this particular phone? What more can be gathered that they don't already have? I think if the FBI wants access to something they should lay out very clearly and concisely what it is they are seeking. Just like with a home search warrant they would lay out an idea of what they're seeking. I'm still going to say they can fuck right off but at least it would give their argument a little more credence.

6559 :: Apple implies FBI screwup: iPhone Apple ID password changed in govt p...
For what it's worth:

The Apple ID password can be changed at icloud.com with a web browser. You can change that without the pin for the phone. Based on my reading of the article, the FBI changed the password of the icloud account, just so someone else who may have also had the password wouldn't log in, maybe delete something, and maybe change the password. However, this doesn't prove the FBI had the full access to unlocking the phone at the lock screen, like they say they want.

The email thing is what made him in Internet-famous, but more importantly he actually invented the 3-way handshake used in TCP setup/teardown, and contributed a ton of smaller ideas to the early Internet.  q.v. RFC 675 for acknowledgement, or his master's thesis which is in a couple of footnotes in Stevens.  He was a fixture of BBN's Distributed Systems group and a kind mentor to hundreds of engineers.  A kind soul with a dry wit.

RIP. Really nice guy who never really got the credit (or money) he deserved. I got to talk to him once, which was difficult to accomplish as he was still just a tech guy, and he was very humble.

Fun fact: we do not know or have documentation of the contents of the first "email". He was just fucking around and claimed it was probably part of the Gettysburg address. 
123
6553 :: Inventor of email and savior of the @ sign, Ray Tomlinson, is dead at 74
He worked at Bolt Beranek and Newman (now Raytheon BBN Technologies) for 49 years, and was still employed there to this day. The president of BBN shared this message to all employees this morning: 

>Dear Colleagues,
 
>It is with great sadness that I write that Ray Tomlinson passed away suddenly on Saturday.
 
>Ray is well known for inventing email and saving the @ sign from obscurity by choosing it to separate the receiver’s name from the host name. Despite creating the most revolutionary communications tool, Ray was always a humble and modest man.  He was interviewed frequently, and often asked the same questions about choosing the @ sign and the proliferation of email.  He always answered patiently and with good humor, whether the interviewer was a noted journalist from NPR, a green reporter from a local paper, or an elementary school student working on a project.  The email story Ray most enjoyed telling is about someone who thanked him for inventing email because it had enabled a family member with a rare disease to communicate with others in similar circumstances scattered around the world.  Ray seemed to find more gratification in connecting those people with a supportive community through email than he did from the numerous awards he earned. 
 
>Ray’s colleagues know that the invention of email represents a small fraction of his many contributions during his 49 years at BBN.  He was one of the four-person team that created TENEX, the first operating system to support virtual memory using paging, wrote one of the first implementations of TCP, and worked on the first object-oriented distributed system. Everyone enjoyed working with Ray, not only because he was a brilliant and imaginative engineer, but because he was also generous with him time and always kind.

For a while, I worked with the guy who invented the concept of a mailing list. He, in turn, for a while, had an email address on every computer on the internet. You could email him at "stef@..." and regardless of what you put after it, he'd get the mail. (Of course, there were only a dozen machines on the internet at the time.)

2. They do not roll it over. So I still get that extra 49.99 gigs? Nope, too fucking bad.
3. $10/50gb isn't even close to wholesale data prices. It's 20,000% markup.
4. I still pay it even if I'm using off-peak. So it's a lie to claim that it's about congestion.
5. They continue to "increase speeds for free". Why wouldn't they? They want me to use it as quickly as possible, so I can spend the rest of the billing cycle paying $10/50gb.

It all went well until that final letter, when Comcast twisted things around saying that there wasn't an issue because they informed me of the data cap a long time ago. Being informed about it wasn't an issue. I knew I had a data cap. It was the data cap itself that was an issue, you complete idiots.

VLC does a remarkable number of thing...

I've often wondered why someone doesn't write a tech book on all the neat things you can do with VLC.  It needs a book... no... it *deserves* a book.

That said, the one thing that VLC hasn't been very good at lately is having a dead simple interface.  It also has some issues with certain codecs that other players seems to be doing a slightly better job at.

The long and short of all of this is:

- I use VLC when I want to get something done no other "player" can do

- when I just want to watch a movie, I use MPV

Fighting piracy with legal action is a waste of time and money. The real and proper way to fight piracy is to provide content people want, at a price they're comfortable with, and in a manner that is convenient to them. It's why services like Steam, Netflix, and Spotify are so popular. You'll never stamp out piracy outright. What you can do is convert an enormous portion of current or potential pirates into paying customers.

Piracy is free marketing, I have purchased dozens of CDs, but none of them without first downloading the music and seeing if I liked it first.

That's how it was in the beginning when rights' organisations in Denmark got court orders to block domains. A few ISPs tried to fight it. Today the interpretation of the rulings basically mean as soon as one website is judged to infringe, all ISPs have to block them. I'm not sure how much of this is voluntary.

6549 :: The Austrian branch of T-Mobile is refusing to block access to The Pi...
Last time I checked, this is called "Legal overreach".  Because the local music 'rights' group should be applying for the same order *in a court of law*.  Instead of changing the law without input fromt he biggest market owners (consumers), and siding with the worst elements (such as the SoundExchange program and Prenda Law).

The *Napster* case SHOULD have seen a greater embracing of what the Internet had to offer; in a moment of altruism, the core organisations behind that lawsuit could have adapted, and actually made *more* money by connecting people.

Instead, what those same organisations did was double-speak, lie and deceive (in such a way as people those organisation claimed to represent sued for proper accounting to be employed - see also: *Marshall Mathers*).

I don't care about the ads specifically.
  
For me Adblock is a security issue.  The overwhelming majority of malicious code comes in through Flash and Java ads hosted by third party ad networks.  

I'm generally OK with ads from Google because they take security seriously.  It's everything else that I don't want to deal with.  

Pro-tip: If you want people to see your ads just host them yourself and make them be either text or static images.

I would uninstall adblock, gladly sit through the ad, and probobly buy a coke.

Vine users prove every day that you can make great short videos that people can watch over and over.

I want to help out my favorite channels, I really do. But when I have to sit through a half minute ad about Canada's liberal party with no skip option, then ten seconds into the video a banner popup blocks the lower tenth of the video that won't ever go away until you hit the tiny X, it makes watching the videos nolonger worth it.

The most effective means for a terrorist to evade detection is the use of a burner phone for single operations.

http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/paris-terrorist-attacks-burner-phones-not-encryption/

> New details of the Paris attacks carried out last November reveal that it was the consistent use of prepaid burner phones, not encryption, that helped keep the terrorists off the radar of the intelligence services.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/us/tashfeen-malik-islamic-state.html

> Investigators have also found evidence that in their final days, Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik tried to erase their electronic footprints, another sign of premeditation. They destroyed several electronic devices, including two smashed cellphones found in a trash can near their home, and erased emails, officials said.

> When they were killed, Ms. Malik had what investigators believe might have been a “burner phone,” meant to be used for a short time and discarded, with no social media apps or other identifying information on it. Despite their efforts, the couple’s computers, phones and other electronics provide the best hope for reconstructing their communications and motives.

Hell, even local law enforcement immediately flags mass burner phones as suspicious because they are an effective tool for criminals:

http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article49272780.html

> FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton said Friday the agency had been contacted by local law enforcement officials about the cellphone purchases and also was aware of the propane tank thefts.

> Criminals sometimes use prepaid cellphones to avoid surveillance because the devices can make it harder for investigators to link a phone to a particular person. And terrorists and insurgents have used them in recent years as triggering mechanisms on homemade explosives.

> Local police departments and sheriffs offices in Macon, Lebanon, Jefferson City, Columbia, Cape Girardeau, Jackson and Ava said they received reports of people buying large numbers of cellphones from Wal-Mart stores.

While I agree with the sentiment of the article, I would like to point out that good journalism does not fudge the facts to promote a narrative. TOR and VPN's are very specifically encrypted communication networks. Trying to say they are not only discredits the other information presented in the article.

6530 :: Reddit's ‘warrant canary’ is dead, hinting at U.S. demand for its use...
This whole situation confuses me. Hasn't the government/NSA been able to see what we're doing on here the whole time? 

I always thought they could see whatever we do through our IP address, did Reddit find a way to block them out at one point or something? 

Reddit doesn't seem to collect much information at all from its users, you don't even have to confirm an email address so what can they possibly give the government? And how have they previously been able to deny them the information in question? 

What would they want to see on Reddit so bad? Dank memes and interesting articles?

Is this a big deal and something I should worry about?


Sorry about my lack of knowledge on the whole thing. The more I read about it the more questions I have.

How is this supposed to work? Does the missing canary represent 1 warrant or 100? What will it mean when the canary comes back? Wouldn't it be better to have 1,000 canaries and have one disappear each time a warrant comes in?

Like a lot of others have said, I bet Robin (the April Fools' "joke") is Reddit intentionally creating junk data to throw investigators off. For the uninitiated, Robin is a chatroom service created by Reddit on April 1st, 2016, that throws users into a chatroom with a random person and allows them to vote to GROW the chat (by merging with another), STAY where they are (creating a private subreddit), or ABANDON the chat. There are pretty much two kinds of groups - those who decide to STAY somewhere after they reach a certain amount of participants, and those who GROW until their user numbers are in the thousands. The first group obviously creates junk data in the form of closed off subreddits that often don't go anywhere after a day or so (sorry STAYers), and the second one could obviously create a lot of junk data if they are logging the chats - potentially gigabytes, even if they're stored in plaintext. And then there's the issue of the related names (Robin vs canary)...

Presumably if they changed the FTP link for the iso file, they changed the MD5 signatures that were on the site as well.

Whenever I download an iso file I always check the MD5 signature of that file against what's on their official website, but that wouldn't have done me any good in this case.  Is there some kind of external MD5 signature repository that I could check against instead?  That would be somewhat more secure, since the hackers would have to compromise both the distro's official site, as well as the third-party signature repository.

This will help improve the democratic oversight by the population to those whose job is theoretically to be the representatives of our will by legislating and negotiating in accordance with it. I don't believe that most of our systems have the tools to enforce actual democracy, but at least information will help strengthen the few tools that we do have.

Now we wait for the experts in the different fields to analyse this information properly; while there is rarely such thing as an objective analysis, it's a good thing to have multiple readings of a document, especially when the text is openly accessible and those readings can be criticised with it in hand.

TTIP is only good for the lobbyists and their large corporate sponsors. It will not be good for anyone else. 
Fuck the supposed extra economic activity that is expected. I'd rather have a transparent system of domestic laws and bilateral trade agreements than some behind the scenes arbitration for and by large corporates. 
It disgusts me that anyone in their right mind thinks these plans to be a good idea. Must have been paid a lot or promissed some nice cushy highpaying jobs to all the politicians involved.
We must work for laws that will prevent politicians from taking any job in a sector they were involved with in their decision making in their political career. At least for 5 to 10 years. 
And even then I suspect they'll find a way around that restriction. But anyone can see it is to much of a temptation for most politicians with their bank acccount on their mind instead of the common good or the welfare of the people they are supposed to represent.

You know all the companies that promise when you sign up for their product or service that they will never give your information away?

They are not necessarily lying, but so far any time a company like that has gone bankrupt or through restructuring or had its assets bought by another company they ended up selling your info.

It is best to look at it like anything you say or do will be used against you. If they have the info they will use it to make money.

The best defence is not to go with the company that makes the best promises but act as if they will all sell you out sooner or later.

Regardless of who he backs, there is a widespread problem in the way terrorism is viewed. Saying "which could get worse in the future" plays right into the problem. In theory, if we accept that the ultimate goal of Islamic terrorism is to annihilate the western way of life, then are things like this and the Patriot Act not accomplishing the goal for them? I'm not saying it's all some government ploy to enslave us or exert more control, but it scares me that so many are more than willing to treat these things like a necessary safety instead of a drastic answer to a sensationalized problem.

122
6489 :: Bill Gates says he was 'disappointed' by reports he backs FBI in Appl...
I don't think the issue here is anyone standing against the general idea that having access to information like that would prevent things like terrorism...the problem is that EVERYONE, including very large corporations, know that the government isn't just going to use it for that, and you're a fool if you would believe they would.  By all accounts, it's basically written on the wall that the situation at hand is being used as a core event to try and force a broad and enveloping access for lots of uses, most of which, I'm sure, Gates would stand firmly against.

Bill Gates offered the opinion I'm sure ALL of these people have who are standing against the FBI...the problem is they are trying to FORCE their way into something they have no right to access and should be fighting to protect as private information without access as they are requesting.

He also said something to the like of "you won't find a single tech company that will agree to giving up its data."
Within hour the mainstream media completely misrepresented what he said as if he just came out and said: "Murica!! Terrorism bad!"

Should a terrorist be forced to give up their right to privacy and have the contents of their phone searched? ABSOLUTELY.

There is a concept called tipping point.  It has been calculated that all that is required to move a new idea from outlier that is only used by early adaptors to mainstream is uptake by 8 percent of the population.  Right now,  electric cars are outliers.  Only a small percentage of the population would even consider owning one.  But if uptake were to move to 8 percent,  suddenly lots more people would want to be like all those other people and would want one too. 

Sorry he wouldn't be creating competition,  he would be creating a movement,  where he already has the lead.  Fucking brilliant.

6486 :: "Cure the air, not the cars.": Elon Musk proposes that instead of pay...
You already see emissions regulations leading to electric cars. VW is already working on them, and claims that a significant portion of their products will be electric in a few years - admitting that diesel cannot reach the required goals. 

What we have now is working. If the desire is to speed up the change, then initiatives need to be balanced between letting the market decide what is the best solution, which may take time, or forcing a non-ideal solution by government intervention.

Telling a car manufacturer it must make electric cars doesn't solve any problems if people don't want to buy them. We have the same issue with ethanol in gas, in that blending requirements exceed demand for blended gas. As a result we've wasted billions of dollars on non-viable government chosen "winners".

Translation: give the money to me instead.

Not saying environmentally friendly cars aren't good (although the share that personal cars have on greenhouse gases is not actually that big anyway compared to industrial and agricultural emissions which are the real problem), just saying that his opinion doesn't sound objective. If reddit weren't in love with him, these comments would be far more negative and filled with comments of "corporate handouts" and 1%ers out of touch and what-not.
38
6486 :: "Cure the air, not the cars.": Elon Musk proposes that instead of pay...
That's a bad idea. Manufacturers will always only build the cars they have demand for. If you force VW to just build a certain kind of car that is likely to not work at all with their market position and all that would happen is VW having built a car that no one buys while their old customers just buy elsewhere.

If the state wants to promote low emission cars they have to do it in a way that hits all manufacturers the same way. The correct thing to do right now is to punish VW for breaking the law and changing legislation in a way that makes emissions testing of diesel cars reflect their actual emissions better (Real Drive Emissions testing). Then improve infrastructure for electric cars (fast loading stations) and make electric cars more common by making state employes drive them wherever possible.

People were pretty disposable when I worked at Amazon. Retention was low enough, but Amazon outright told us several times that if we didn't want to work 80+ hours a week we'd be better off quitting since we all agreed to work "occasional" overtime when getting hired.

He watches his co-workers (5 in his group) take vacations, see their drs, and he can't. Sure he could just take a day off and not get paid but we have kids and bills and it's too scary to miss a dollar. Yet they tell him over and over how valuable he is, and how he is worth so much more than they are paying him. But they won't make him an employee because they save money keeping him as a contractor. They hold the carrot of full-time employment out in front of him all the time. It's terrible. Like an abusive relationship you can't leave because you're convinced this time they will come through. He's interviewing and I can't wait to be rid of that company. Horrible people all of them.

This seems bizarre to me - not just because it's evil, but because it [doesn't sound sustainable](http://www.greensocietycampaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CRAZY-PILLS.png) from a fiscal and business standpoint. 

I've always been told that it's a net loss to a company to replace an existing employee because of the time it takes the new person to learn the in-house system. Amazon is spending a LOT of time and money hiring and on-boarding new employees constantly, while flushing their previous efforts to bring people up to speed down the tube. It's a big hidden cost of their chosen method.

Also, they're hiring humans, not robots. It seems just short of insane to fire an otherwise excellent person over a minor performance bobble or a life-outside-work crisis. Does Amazon honestly believe they can replace that individual with someone who will *literally never* make an error or have a family member die? Even if they believe that it's worthwhile to hang onto people only until their first hiccup, the well is going to run dry. If Amazon keeps firing and replacing their bottom 10%, inevitably some new employees they bring in are going to be worse than the ones they just chucked out.

It seems vastly more efficient to give employees a sustainable workload (40-50 hour weeks) and just hire MORE of them to do the same amount of work. That eliminates the burn-out churn and the productivity lost when constantly teaching the basics to new employees. And they could probably pay them all less, given that they're no longer expected to work 80-hour weeks plus vacations and weekends. Productivity would go up, since it's been shown a 6-hour day is more efficient than a longer one. I bet that once you factor in those intangibles, Amazon would break even.

The blog post has a frustrating lack of detail. What company were they going against, and how did Newegg win? 

Edit: [This is the case against TQP where a jury found they did infringe and were liable for a $2.3 million verdict.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/newegg-wins-tqp-patent-case-after-challenging-judge-over-delays/) The judge (who is very well known in patent circles) granted a post-trial motion for judgement as a matter of law in favor of Newegg. [The order is here](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TQP-Order.pdf) for those interested.

Also, the patent is still valid and TQP can continue asserting it against whoever they wish.

I remember when SCO tried to claim it owned Unix and therefore Linux and started shaking down users for "copyright infringement" payments. Then a judge decided that Novell actually owned the intellectual property rights, and that SCO had breached their previous agreement with Novell and signed licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun. Biggest egg-on-your-face moment ever, and it was awesome. SCO was just a patent troll company, they fought legal battles for 5 years and not only lost their case, they ended up destroying the entire company overnight. To have been in that courtroom when that decision was handed down...Priceless.

6462 :: FCC fines Hilton Hotels $25,000 for stonewalling their inquiries into...
$25,000 might seem like a slap on the wrist, but this is just for obstructing a government probe into their operations.

The total fine could be a lot more once the FCC determines how much Hilton Hotels was gouging customers.  

EDIT:  /u/rekhytkael has a really great explanation for the $25k fine.  I'm going to copy and paste so it gets a little more visibility.

>The FCC has fined Hilton for the obstruction of an investigative probe; a probe which was intended to look into the matter of Hilton jamming personal WiFi hotspots. The fine is purely for obstruction and says nothing of the validity or findings of the probe (which has not been completed).

>$25k is a pitance to a company like Hilton, but the FCC is not authorized to make the fine any larger. The FCC has rules and regulations that are standardized, not subjective. $25k is all that they can levy against Hilton for mere obstruction. At such a point in time when a probe uncovers wrongdoing, the FCC will be free to impose a MUCH larger fine in accordance with the magnitude of the offense.

>Additionally, at such a point in time when wrongdoing is exposed, any number of individuals can attempt to sue> Hilton for arbitrarily high damages (most likely resulting in a class action suit where everyone involved gets a payout of 7 whole dollars).

>The $25k fine is paltry, but it is indicative of things to come as far as lawsuits and fines if wrongdoing is found in further investigations. Combined with the influx of bad publicity, Hilton is looking at some hefty financial losses. In perspective, this article was published yesterday, and Hilton has probably lost far more than $25k in business in the past 24 hours alone.

>TL;DR - It's a fine for obstruction, not for blocking wi-fi.

I stay at Hilton hotels a LOT. I truly believe they jam MIFIs. I know my MiFi works great outside the hotel, the closer I get the worse it gets. I have notices on a handful of occasions when I am at a Hilton where Mifi sucks. When there is a power failure, MiFi starts working really well. It will then stop when the power comes back and the wireless networking at the hotel turns back on. 

Not definitive proof by any means but certainly enough to make you serious wonder. I get their wifi for free but I prefer MiFi when doing business as I have much more control over the people sharing the connection and its encryption

6453 :: The gloves are off: FBI argues it can force Apple to turn over iPhone...
Can we also not forget that it's extremely unlikely that anything of value is to be found on this phone. This was his work phone, which the shooters decided not to smash into pieces like they both did with their personal phones. Does anybody think they just forgot to smash this one too? Or, did the shooter who worked *for the government* assume (rightly) that if he did terroristy things on his work phone that he could have been found out. And that consequently he kept the bad stuff on his personal phone only.

And even if there is something on this phone, let's also not forget that the FBI ruined their legitimate chance of recovering it in the first place. Within a day of the shooting the FBI (before consulting Apple) had the employer IT reset the phone password. This disconnected the phone from iCloud which they otherwise could have used to hack the backup if they brought the phone to the shooter's home WiFi.

So they can argue all they want about how it is not burdensome for Apple to help them, but I think it is idiotic to claim that when *they* are the one's who created the circumstances that they are now in, not Apple. It's like shooting out their own car tires and then whining that Apple won't help them put the spare on.

I don't think everyone realizes how lucky we are that Apple is taking this stance. Even it is for marketing purposes, which I don't believe. The government says they are the only ones who can protect our liberty and freedom. Secret courts with sealed rulings, consolidating untold power to the few...they clearly have shown they are not. Apple could have easily rolled over like every other corporation. Because of them we have a chance to avoid an authoritarian Orwellian style government. This is that first step...it wouldn't be tomorrow, next year or even next decade but this would be the first step.

As Apple has not committed any crime  and is not suspected of committing a crime in relation to the case at hand, or unless the government is going to claim that software is not property (good by digital piracy enforcement) then I don't think there is any existing law to allow them to seize Apples property by force in this situation. However I am not a lawyer so I could be wrong.

Based in all the outrage recently, most people must not be stuck with an ISP as garbage as Mediacom. 350GB is the highest cap you can have (at least in my area) and has been that way for 2 years. $10 for every 50 GB over. I cannot have any other ISP in my apartment complex, not that it matters because CenturyLink would be just as bad.

They don't even provide decent data usage tracking options. The only info they can give you is total for the month and only for the past 3 months. They inject warnings when you're near your cap into your browser and have inaccurate usage data.

That is the picture of the future where this sort if behavior is condoned and monopolies are allowed to stay.

If any legislator tries saying this is how the free market should operate, I now have a rebuttal. You can buy a 4k TV now, but only Netflix actually is capable of streaming in 4k.  Cable TV has nothing that hi-res, and won't for years. Now, if you have a data cap, you're probably gonna run into it steaming 4k media. This is a perfect example of a shady business practice restraining an industry. Not only are streaming services affected, but ultimately TV manufacturers as well.

We just broke our cap for the first time last month.  We pay for cable and internet service.  I had surgery and was using Netflix on the bedroom TV and with my husband downloading a few games we went over.  It made me so angry because we already pay for cable and internet, we should not(anyone should not) be limited on usage.  How do they expect people to play online games, download Xbox games, use Netflix or amazon services and make Skype calls to family that's long distance which is really just normal usage to me.  We pay so much a month and this will prevent us from using the internet to its full potential.  It is so frustrating and like we are going back in time.  I remember when Sprint had unlimited internet and now we have 2gb each a month on our phones.  It is so irritating.  Using  Pandora, YouTube, Reddit and GPS can make that to away in less time than a month.  This needs to be fixed.  The internet is expanding and has so many uses now why are they allowed to do this.

6438 :: CISPA is back with a new name. Since Congress seems to be stuck in 19...
I was an intern in a congressional office, this isn't as clever as you think

Our office did have a fax machine, every office did. If we wanted to send a fax we would have to do it via the machine.

But we never received a single fax through the fax machine. When we were sent a fax it would be sent to an email address that I had to manage. I would then go through the email and sort them. Generally, if an email didn't contain a person's full name and mailing address, or if that address wasn't in our district, then it would go straight to the trash. Policy related emails would go to the relevant staffer.

Now, the logic of this next step eludes me but it was procedure. Whenever we got physical mail from a constituent it would be put in a special blue envelope and sent to a place that would turn it into a digital format. That digital mail would then go to the LC, who would draft a response and mail it to the constituent. The digital mail is kept on file and the physical mail is eventually shredded. So making physical mail digital does help us with filing. Here's what I didn't understand, when a fax came in from a CONSTITUENT it would be printed out, and then put in the same envelope with the mail, and converted digitally. Why it has to go from digital to physical back to digital I don't understand.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you plan of spamming your congressman with faxes, they're realistically only going to print out one copy. If you plan on spamming somebody who isn't your congressman then an intern is going to filter it out and nobody else will ever see it. 

Contacting YOUR congressman can yield positive results, don't let me discourage you! Just be sure to include your full name and mailing address and I promise that somebody will see it.

It's a state secret that we're spying on our own citizens. Yeah no, I don't think so, it's more that the majority of people have the I have nothing to hide mentality so they are complacent with it. 

And I can't tell if the telecoms are being blackmailed into this by the feds, or if they literally just get paid for doing this. Because unless there is profit to be made, why waste money on this?

It really is a great example of what would happen if we were to let the government stick backdoors in everything under the sun. That is, if they haven't done so already....

Well it's been proven that the NSA intercepts crates of modems heading straight out of the factory and installs their own firmware giving them full access to all traffic that passes through once it gets to you. I wouldn't doubt that they've begun doing the same thing to phones and other electronics without approval. 

Stingray towers bypass all of that and grab all the info on your cell for them to browse at their leisure and those are open to local law enforcement and were until very recently allowed to be used without a warrant, pretty much whenever... 

If that's how they toss these things around, I wonder what the government guys we can't see or even know about are doing.

6398 :: Chicago to Apply 9% 'Netflix Tax'
What's even the point of this tax?  The revenue gained is probably a rounding error on the financial statements of that city.  But it discourages innovation - would a Chicago-based startup that streams video be forced to put infrastructure in place to collect this tax?  That's quite a burden on a startup.  Seems like a large cost for a really, really small gain.

6398 :: Chicago to Apply 9% 'Netflix Tax'
I love Chicago but I am so glad I moved out of that area. Nothing but politicians getting rich while the budget is never enough. It has one of, if not the highest sales tax in the country. 11% I think. And all the freaking tolls, probably generate millions per day. Yet if it snows they can't pay the plow truck drivers. A few years ago they had to cancel 4th of July fireworks because no money. That money is going somewhere, just not where it's supposed to go.

Edit: It's been brought to my attention that the sales tax is in fact 9.25%. Sorry for the confusion. It's been a while. 

However, when combining *all* the taxes, Chicago ranks 3rd highest in the country behind Birmingham, AL and Glendale, AZ. I guess Chicago is shooting for number one...

Edit 2: I came across the above stat when I googled earlier as I was trying to become a tax expert, and I can't find the source. My apologies. I tried finding it again and after 20 minutes I give up and here's what I could find:

The fact that the people spoke on this issue in record numbers of comments and petitions yet Congress still sides with money is an insult to our democracy and an embarrassment.

Leave the fucking internet alone. Stop trying to turn it into some sort of AOL pay-per-view business model. Communication is the lifeblood of a country yet we let a couple molopolies hold back our technological progression and dictate our evolution as a nation. What a fucking joke. For what? So a few politicians can retire with an extra hundred thousand in the bank and a cushy job at Comcast. A company who's business model is reaching a little deeper into our pockets when their share prices stagnate.

I'm not Obama's biggest fan but I really think over the next decade people will look back and realize Obama was one of the most intelligent, level headed presidents we have seen in a long, long time.

A friend of mine gave me some advice when I was ranting about Obama awhile back. He said:

"What a president does very rarely effects the now so don't judge a president by how is term is playing out. What a president does effects the decade to follow his term. Judge a president by what happens after he is out of office."

It hit me hard because I'm 27. I matured into an adult while Bush was in office. It never occurred to me exactly how bad he was fucking up our country because you never feel the effects right away. It wasn't until a year or two after he left office that shit hit the fan and 90% of it was because of moves Bush made. Not trying to place blame on Bush, but after my friend said that too me, I realized it made very good sense.


EDIT: I was just offering another perspective.  Calm down people.

These people, the GOP especially, though the Dems aren't excluded, are useless corporatist assholes; who apparently will stop at nothing to force through legislation that is beneficial to their donors. No matter if the American people have spoken, or if they have to pass it in secret buried in some inconsequential budget bill passed at mid night. These people are demonstrably and unforgivably; perpetually disingenuous  assholes. And we have to work together to get them as far away from the levers of legislation as possible in the next cycle.

I mean look at every fucking issue these morons are pushing in both Congress and at the state level. The GOP has to die now. They are shockingly blatant puppets for corporatism. At least Clinton tries to hide it with high fives and robotic laughter.

If you're sending sensitive documents through email, it should be you and the recipient with no one else involved. This is encryption. It is not some terroristic threat to society.

Why is this so hard for politicians to understand:

**If you insert backdoors into encryption then the bad guys will quite simply avoid those tools and use the myriad of other available options that are either already open-source and freely available or will get products that are created outside of the jurisdiction that has imposed these regulations.**

Only ordinary people who don't know any better are going to get screwed here. Criminals aren't going to bat an eye at this load of shit whether it passes or not. *That* is the reality.
358
6371 :: Hillary Clinton hints that she supports backdoors in encryption: ...c...
And with all her knowledge, please explain how this backdoor will only be circumvented by "official and legal" means. 

Anyone who knows anything about security will tell you, if you allow a backdoor, then that is another point of weakness that can be exploited. 

Since our police and law enforcement agencies use the weakest security, and least technologically trained agents, where does the secure part come in. 

Does she really think the detective on the streets, the one actually needing the access, will have a clue how to keep that data safe just inside their chain of custody. They lose evidence all the time, how is data going to be any better, you cannot steal physical evidence via the internet though.  

So after we have given you the backdoor, who will protect it once you get your hands on it, so its not just a backdoor, we are going to need an entire industry built around keeping the data safe. 

This sounds more like the start of a new department, something along the lines of Data Land Security or such. Another way to suck our tax dollars into the abyss, and for what, so they don't have to do real police work, they can just sit on their asses, collect random data sets and use that as they see fit. 

Maybe its just me.

6370 :: Nest intentionally bricks thousands of home automation hubs.
I bought a Revolv hub after a lot of research years ago.  I've got quite a few home automation items set up through it.  A couple of **weeks** after buying it there was a change to their website that they had been bought by Google and you could no longer buy the Revolv hub but they would continue supporting it for now.  I've been living with a pit in my stomach ever since.  Today that pit turned into a Xenomorph and exploded out of my chest.  
189
6370 :: Nest intentionally bricks thousands of home automation hubs.
And this is why a home automation hub should not rely on the cloud to function. 

I'm a SWE that works on a high end home automation hub solution. All of the functional portions of the hub can function without an external Internet connection. There is no need to speak to "the cloud" to turn your bathroom light on, have your shades raise at sunrise, run your thermostat schedule, open your door lock, turn your bathroom fan off after it has been on for 15 minutes. 

The "cloud" is reserved for software / firmware updates, advanced data analysis, etc.. 

We could shut down our servers today and everything would be fine. 

That being said, my company makes everything from the hub to the shades to the thermostats to the keypads and dimmers, so the hub is more used as a stepping stone to buy all of our expensive stuff. 
100
6370 :: Nest intentionally bricks thousands of home automation hubs.
This is a major problem for bringing cloud devices to consumers. If suddenly one day people wake up and their lightswitches, thermosats, and appliances don't work (or are missing some functionality) then they won't be buying any more cloud stuff in the future.

If this happens too often then the well will be poisoned and nobody will bother with it.
35
6370 :: Nest intentionally bricks thousands of home automation hubs.
You picked a closed platform that depends 100% on the cloud.

This was always bound to happen over a long enough period of time. I can't envision a reasonable scenario where a company supports a closed platform indefinitely past its life cycle. Best case for you and google would have been what, supporting for another 5-10 years? Or until the last 10% of devices? the timeline was always finite.

This is why the future of software has always been open standards and platforms. Buyer beware.
32
6370 :: Nest intentionally bricks thousands of home automation hubs.
Given the amount of FOSS Software in use by the product, they should open source the server and release a method to change the connection parameters on the hub so the community can continue to run it.

6349 :: Comcast’s data caps aren’t just bad for subscribers, they’re bad for ...
It's ridiculous that in this day and age, people have to worry about their internet usage like it's some kind of limited resource.
2914
6349 :: Comcast’s data caps aren’t just bad for subscribers, they’re bad for ...
This behavior is exactly why Comcast needs to be regulated like a public utility or we need to allow local governments to provide their own  broadband service. 

The market is structured in such a way as to give them (telecoms) an unfair advantage. 

Let me be clear. There are definitive economic benefits in allowing a company with incredibly high infrastructure costs to have a monopoly over a service area. In economics this is called [Natural Monopoly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). This prevents the duplication of efforts, and allows for a more efficient use of resources, avoiding [problems like this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2_HclPN8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/lgpoxpq2odq4bdbqaf3x.jpg) and [this](http://www.uh.edu/engines/nycandwires.jpg) (early 20th century NYC), where countless companies have overlapping, redundant infrastructure. 

Due to the market power this gives a company, they must also be heavily regulated in order to prevent them from taking advantage of their customers. The alternative is to allow governments to take on this function for themselves. 

The thing is, all water, gas, and electric utilities are heavily regulated by state and federal agencies in a way that telecoms are not. The three so-called "public" utilities are seen as necessities for life, while telecom has only recently begun to be viewed that way. As a result, public utilities cannot charge excessive fees for service, and in exchange we give them a near-monopoly over their service territory.

In California, for example, regulatory requirements only allow gas and electric utilities to make money on capital investments. This gives utilities a direct incentive to invest in new infrastructure, because that's how they make money. This simultaneously removes any incentive to overcharge per kWh or to induce customers to use more electricity - even if they did, California utilities wouldn't make any additional money from this practice. 

Instead, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) authorizes a certain rate of return - usually a 5%-10% markup on base electricity cost - based on capital investments and how well the utility runs its business. (Bit of an oversimplification here - this is called "decoupling" if you want to look for more details.)

*If we had a policy like that for telecoms, you can bet broadband would be cheaper and bandwidth would be higher.*

What's more, most states don't restrict a city's right to establish a utility for water, gas, or electric. So why do we do that for telecoms? 

Telecoms, meanwhile, are given the same preferential access to service territories in most states, but are not subject to the same price controls. They exploit this advantage by charging unreasonable prices, lagging behind in infrastructure investment and in providing higher bandwidth, and instituting datacaps that, by Comcast's own admission, are there exclusively to pad the bottom line (see [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151001/05131832403/as-comcast-broadband-usage-caps-expand-company-still-refuses-to-admit-they-even-have-caps.shtml), [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml), and [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150814/12144431948/comcast-admits-broadband-usage-caps-are-cash-grab-not-engineering-necessity.shtml) for details). 

If we're going to allow a company monopolistic control over a service territory, we can't also allow them carte blanche with their price structure. Basic economics says they'll abuse the privilege, and *that's exactly what they've done.*

Even better, *we used to regulate telecoms like utilities.* The overlapping infrastructure and high-profile bankruptcies of many of the overlapping telecom companies were some of the major causes of the regulatory actions and acquisitions that culminated in the foundation of the AT&T monopoly in the early-to-mid 1900s. AT&T, at the time, was regulated in a manner similar to a utility under the Natural Monopoly framework.^1

This is one of many examples of what we economists would call a market failure. Part of the problem is the way the regulatory agencies view telecom. It needs to be considered a necessity and regulated in the same manner as a public utility. Recent changes at the FCC have moved in the right direction, but there's a lot further to go. 

Do not be complacent. This will be an incredibly difficult fight and there are many other important and relevant viewpoints related to this that should be duly considered. 

I don't mean to suggest that this is the only viable option, just that it's been proven to work in the past with both telecoms and other public utilities. There are other valid solutions that should be duly considered; this is one of them.

^1 *The History of the Telephone* by Herbert Newton Casson. Pages 190-195 and 270-290

**TL;DR:** In a 21st century economy, telecom access is a necessity, just like electric, water, and gas, and it should either be regulated as such, or local governments should have the ability to establish their own broadband utilities. When you allow a company to have unfettered control over a service area without also regulating their business practices and cost structure, the customers (read: everyone) lose.  

*With the recent regulatory changes at the FCC, there is no better time to [submit our complaints, experiences, and comments to the FCC](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) regarding Comcast, Time Warner, CenturyLink and all the rest's actions. We are all being taken advantage of, and it is up to us to make sure the FCC comes out of this on our side.*

*Also do not underestimate the power of contacting your senators and representatives. They usually only hear the voices of the lobbyists. If we show them how much this issue matters to us, things will change.*

Send complaint to FCC.

Mention there is no "data cap" on cable boxes. Cable boxes are just transfering data from the server to your house, the EXACT same as watching netflix on internet.

There is no benefit to a data cap, this is being done to makeup for lost cable-tv revenue. Once again, they do not limit how much tv you can watch.

AT&T has quietly rolled out a 250GB data cap for Uverse customers where I live. I had to switch to...Time Warner, which has billed me the wrong amount every month for 3 months now because they can't remember that I have a 1 year promotion.

Yup.  A year ago I was paying $250 for Internet and Cable TV, so I cut the cord.  Next year I'll be paying $250 for Internet and my selection of services like Netflix, Hulu, CBS all access, etc.

... or more.  Like I have these nice video security cameras around my house that record "to the cloud."   That uses bandwidth too. And I'll want to add more of them.  All this internet-connected stuff at home is just going to add to the bill.

But what will be most annoying is the auto-play video advertisements that I not only have to suffer through online but now have to pay for as well.

This situation with Comcast makes me feel good about ISPs of *Russia*. Internet is really cheap here unless you live in snowy nowheres of Kamchatka. I pay less than 10$ for 40 megabits with no data caps.

Why is it so cheap? Competition! Networks of Russia were formed largely by small private ISPs very similar to garage startups in nature. Involvement of Comcast-like telecomm giants was minimal. Real competition was in play from the very beginning. And now we have results.

Too bad our goverment now tries to ruin everything by imposing censorship and mass-buying these small ISPs into a govermental ISP giant called Rostelecom.

> If ISPs hope to continue growing their sales and profits moving forward — and as public companies, that is obviously their hope — they need to find new ways to boost revenue.

This is part of the problem with mega companies in the world...  You cannot expect to grow your profits forever.  It says in the article that 80% of the homes in the United States have broadband internet, meaning that growing your income with new customers is going to be increasingly difficult.  And then with the internet providers not competing against anything, they are allowed to do whatever they want as far as pricing.

6349 :: Comcast’s data caps aren’t just bad for subscribers, they’re bad for ...
IF Obama sees the internet as a utility under Title II and a "necessary" part of everyday life, he has to step in and make data caps illegal.

Once again, we have to stress that broadband is **NOT** a commodity like coffee beans.

It's electrons travelling through a wire. It's only FINITE if we let assholes like Comcast call it that.

6354 :: Imgur is being used to create a botnet and DDOS 8Chan
This isn't a DDOS. It's targeting 8chan users and leaving javascript code in their local storage that causes their browsers ping back to a command and control server each time they hit an 8chan page. Thus far the C&C server hasn't sent out any commands (or stopped issuing commands before this was discovered). Over the evening whoever authored this has been updating and changing their code. It only effects very specific imgur images/pages. Why is not yet known.

Things to take away:

* If you visit imgur and 8chan you may very well have a big issue. ~~Clear your localstorage (go to 8chan, open your browsers console, type localstorage and see what's there - then type localstorage = [] and hit enter) as well as all browser private information (cookies, passwords, offline storage, etc).~~ See edit #4 for a better way to ensure you're safe. Don't go to 8chan before clearing all local storage.

* **Imgur is compromised**. This is the big one and should be very worrisome to anyone on this site. There are three possibilities:

1.) There is an exploit in how imgur processes images that allows someone uploading an image to get code injected into the page when someone else loads the image from imgur

2.) Imgur has one or more servers that are compromised

3.) Imgur has a rogue employee injecting malicious code.

In all cases, this is really, really bad. It's very unlikely that a 0day exploit on a site as big as imgur is just being used to go after 8chan (unless it's case 3. and someone has a grudge). This allows whoever knows how to take advantage of the exploit to launch an XSS attack against anyone who visits a malicious page on imgur. And there's no way to tell before visiting the page. **Not all pages on imgur are compromised and right now it appears to be a very small number of images that had malicious payloads sitting on their page**.

How the attack appears to have worked:

1.) Malicious javascript got onto imgur's server somehow (via one of the three routes outlined above)

2.) This js created iframes and embedded a flash file hosted on 8chan. The iframe was off screen so a user would not notice. Since imgur typically uses flash for parts of its functionality flash asking to run on imgur wouldn't be seen as suspicious.

3.) This flash file injected more javascript into the page (while on the surface looking like an innocuous pikachu animation). This javascript was stored to the user's localstorage (which, since the iframe was pointing at 8chan, allowed the attacker to attach js to 8chan's localstorage). It's functionality is to issue a GET request to 8chan.pw (not an 8chan server AFAIK) and then decrypted the response. So far no one has been able to see a response from that web service, meaning it likely wasn't activated yet or has already been deactivated. The outcome is that every time a user visited an 8chan page, it would "phone home" to check for instructions and then execute more javascript code.

I would stress that everyone should disable flash and javascript on imgur for the time being. This attack may not be the only use of this exploit and a lot of very, very bad things could be done through XSS if more people are exploiting this. You should treat the entire site as potentially compromised until imgur addresses this and explains what happened.

Edit: The original thread has been deleted. What the hell. (In fairness this could have been done by the original poster or the mods "for the lulz" since it was in /r/4chan after all).

Edit2: And now it's back

6323 :: Edward Snowden deserves a pardon at home, or else asylum in western E...
People need to understand that the Snowden leaks are easily separated into two broad categories: domestic surveillance and international surveillance.  

The NSA reform going through Congress is about one aspect of domestic surveillance (bulk metadata collection) that was the subject of the very first Snowden leak published.  But the vast majority of Snowden's leaks fall into the latter category: international surveillance.  This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  

Snowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), (not for treason), which applies to:

>**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which ***information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

Now why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.

[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): 

>“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.”

[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):

>Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....
>
>...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.
>
>They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.

[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):

>Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. “Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,” Greenwald said. “***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***”

[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):

>I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation

So even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to "ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.

Here's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:

> Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.
>

I really don't get the backlash here. T-Mobile offers the same plan, with the same "unlimited data" marketing at the same price. In fact, almost every other carrier offers a similar plan at a similar price point via their post paid arms. Boost, Cricket, AT&T Go Phone, Metro PCS, Sprint Prepaid, T-Mobile, Virgin, and almost every single other MVNO are all just as guilty. All this is doing is giving the people who are already paying the same amount for the same type of plan the option to finance or lease higher end phones.

6283 :: EFF proves T-Mobile is throttling all video not just YouTube
Just throwing this out there.  Since we are all stuck with zero rating for the time being and odds are it is not going to go away or get better but more likely to get worse (carriers charging for zero rated services...and they are likely lobbying to get neutrality removed or weakened so they can), T-Mobile is at least offering this as an option and they are not discriminating unlike Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon and limiting this zero rating to only their services.  
  
Take that for what it's worth and please forgive odd typos (wrote this on mobile.)

Even for his main audience, it should be obvious that there is no such thing as a backdoor in encryption remaining exclusively bound to US (intelligence) usage.

So whatever you do with weakening the process affects every participant, from other agencies to script kids over to organized groups aiming for computer fraud etc.

"Your" very own American business relies on a secure and reliable way to handle data. It cannot be in the interest of the industry to run on platforms being designed to be vulnerable. Mr. Bush is harming his own goals.

But these topics dont make it to mainstream media. Furthermore, the older people that vote dont care about net neutrality or encryption.

Except, I don't think I've heard this issue raised in the first two Republican debates or the Democratic ones...oh wait, there still haven't been any Democratic debates yet. Nevermind.

In a weird way, maybe it's Jeb Bush that will bring this discussion to the forefront in the campaign by being *against encryption and privacy*, and then forcing others, both Republicans and Democrats to take a stand on it as well. Then we can see - not who has our backs - but at least who "promises" to have our backs.

There are many users in this thread claiming to know how to spot a shill, but I think that is missing the point. If these shills are doing their job well, they will be indistinguishable from actual users. Many people on this site have strong political opinions and actively participate in political subreddits; are we going to call everyone who has a history of posting for one candidate a shill?

This is scary not only because none of us can really know how much of what we read is from shills and how much is from actual users, but also because an accusation that someone is a shill can instantly undermine a legitimate point. Will every discussion descend into a shill-witch-hunt from now on? Outside of addressing these practices through legislation, or the admins attempting to tackle this in some way, I'm not sure what we can do about it as individual users.

The solution to this is easy. Every employee of a Internet Service Provider has their mileage and speed limit capped at 3mph and 5 miles a day (regardless of vehicle, walking, or biking).

This is why we need a National Broadband Plan. This is like what occurred prior to the interstate highway system.  Our economy is dependant on the internet.  We need a concerted effort to insure adequate access and service well into this century.  This can be done by using the US Postal Service authorization and regulation of interstate commerce clauses in the Constitution.  
We also can't allow ISP's to restrict information access. There needs to be a separation of content providers and delivery.  
We need to define the exchange of information as an essential human right. Like water or air.

> The odd effect of this is that someone tinkering with a file or device that contains a copyrighted work can be made liable (criminally so, if wilfullness and a commercial motive can be shown), for doing so even when no copyright infringement is committed.

Well there's no way that could wrong. 
2334
6284 :: The Final Leaked TPP Text is All That We Feared
Up for a nice start:

> If you dig deeper, you'll notice that all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding.

Reaffirming that the debate around copyright time spans not only was ignored but also ridiculed by even extending the span: 

> Perhaps the biggest overall defeat for users is the extension of the copyright term to life plus 70 years (QQ.G.6), despite a broad consensus that this makes no economic sense, and simply amounts to a transfer of wealth from users to large, rights-holding corporations.

And on "good" points:

> But we have struggled to come up with more than two positive points about the TPP, and even then the absence of these tragic mistakes is a pretty poor example of a positive point. If you look for provisions in the TPP that actually afford new benefits to users, rather than to large, rights-holding corporations, you will look in vain.

Thanks to the EFF folks for taking a closer and expertise-based look. There's a slight chance that the final "final" offers something different but seeing that they got a hold of the draft after the negotiations ended doesn't leave much hope.

That's just one chapter of the deal and also the one where the EFF at least tried to add constructive criticism while negotiating. It remains an interesting challenge as to how the other ingredients turn out but given the impression from above, the next few months may well be the ones of pro-consumer agencies to shine and the influence of corporate advisors to become clear.

"Free Trade," as defined by the above texts, seems a tad bit out of shape.

One of the scariest things is that - in Canada (or Ontario) we have laws in place setting limits on damages that can be claimed by some copyright violations - the TPP would allow corporations to sue the provincial or federal government for damages, forcing them to change legislation that was voted on by Canadian citizens.

I live in northern indiana, about 90 miles from chicago. We used to go to chicago on free museum days. We would save about $140 for the ticket prices, but we paid for tolls, bought crap from the gift shop, would eat lunch there, and then go to legoland and some other shopping after the museum. So even though we were not paying for tickets, we were still spending about $200 - $300 for the day in the area. After rahm emanuel did away with the free days to people living outside illinois we stopped going. I would still drive there to pickup my brother from the airport when he flew in from seattle. But a couple years ago while going to drop him off, I noticed speed cams on garfield ave. the speed limit was 35mph, but where there was a speed cam the limit would drop to 25mph, as soon as you passed the cam the speed limit went back up to 35mph. It was shady trick the city pulled. So I told my brother to start flying into indianapolis it was only a little longer drive, but no tolls, better roads, and no money grabby dirty underhanded tricks like the speed cams. Havent been back since.

As a Chicagoland resident I'm getting a little sick of the city's attitude. This is just another game they're playing, following their standard pattern of behavior:

1. Create a controversial law, figuring that nobody's gonna challenge it. If they do, we'll kill it in court using our powerful attorneys and our clout.

2. Somebody inevitably sues. Game on.

3. The case makes its way through the courts slowly, with the city refusing to back down and appealing every loss as high as it'll go.

4. City inevitably loses, having wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on legal fees and settlement costs.

5. Take that money from taxpayers, without even a shred of remorse at the cost the city is now heaping upon those same taxpayers who didn't even want the law in the first place.

6. Repeat.

Another big issue this is causing is tech companies in Chicago that use cloud services like AWS are also getting an additional 9% tax. I know a few friends that work in places that highly use AWS and say their companies are looking at 20-40k in taxes alone because of this.

While this might not seem like an issue because it's companies getting taxed, they will either start paying employees less to make up for it or just move from Chicago in general. So it ends up hurting residents even more by removing jobs from Chicago.

>The city says it will fight the lawsuit vigorously, according to the Chicago Tribune, which also reports the so-called “Netflix tax” is expected to bring in $12 million annually, and that it is part of a larger attempt by Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to use new fees to close a budget hole.

What budget hole?? I've lived in Illinois for most of my life and it has (especially the NE Suburbs and Chicago) has the HIGHEST taxes I've seen in the US! I don't understand how the hell there are budget shortfalls. I could only understand it if every unemployed individual was given a two bedroom home and three meals a day.

Not only this, but they have a Use Tax that taxes you on out of state purchases ... now I live in Texas!

Couldn't people register the account under another zip code and still use it in the city?

Seems like the main arguments are that the legislature didn't pass the tax(it was called a "levy" and imposed by the comptroller) and that it taxes internet and disc services at different rates.

So the legal complaint isn't that a Netflix tax is illegal, just that this particular tax was implemented in an illegal way.  I'm guessing that even if this tax gets struck down, Netflix taxes are going to start becoming commonplace regardless.

Netflix should just cancel service in Chicago.  That will get people to complain to their government officials.  No tax netflix comes back.

6268 :: AT&T doesn’t want to pay $100M fine, says throttling didn’t harm cust...
I could maybe understand if it was just throttling when the network was overburdened, but its not. Its throttling when *unlimited* subs hit "5GB for LTE users or 3GB for customers on slower networks."

AT&T should follow their own contracts.

>“The Commission’s findings that consumers and competition were harmed are devoid of factual support and wholly implausible,” AT&T wrote in a response to the FCC

It's fine. I'll testify. They've throttled me in previous years when I went over my allotted 5GB. It was down to 100-300Kbps, I tested the rates. When I called them and asked them what's going on, they had me reset my network settings (so they could wipeout all my saved wifi passwords, thanks ATT!) to no avail. When I specifically asked them if I was being throttled, they said no.

>The FCC said it could have fined AT&T much more, up to $16,000 per violation for millions of violations. But it chose $100 million to avoid "an astronomical figure" while making the fine big enough to deter future violations.

In the early days of RIAA bullying bullshit, they'd sue everyday people for millions of dollars and (basically) force them to settle out of court. The FCC could have sued ATT for way more and it should have. Companies are people too, right?

>"AT&T said the FCC does not have the authority to require it to allow customers to evade early termination fees or stop using the term 'unlimited' or to bear the 'scarlet letter' of having to inform its customers that it violated the transparency rule, which it called a violation of the First Amendment," 

I'm sorry, did AT&T miss the part where Net Neutrality was passed? The FCC does the authority to do that.

6268 :: AT&T doesn’t want to pay $100M fine, says throttling didn’t harm cust...
This still happens to me as an AT&T customer, in fact they texted me only a couple weeks ago letting me know that I was close to my 5g data "limit" (even though i have unlimited data) and if I go over, they'll slow it down.

6268 :: AT&T doesn’t want to pay $100M fine, says throttling didn’t harm cust...
I've had the AT&T unlimited data for approx. 8-ish years give or take a few months. 

I run social media for an agricultural non-profit and use my personal phone to make in-the-field Facebook,Twitter,Instagram, etc updates. My service jumps between 4G/4GLTE.

I've only been throttled a few times, BUT, that is only because I am forced to "save" my data for fear of being throttled when I need it the most. When I am throttled it is so drastic that I cannot upload a single picture, refresh my facebook page feed or even navigate to some websites. I live approx 1 mile outside city limits and do not have access to any standard internet connections that are faster than cell networks. This means that using a wifi connection at home is not possible. My only access to reliable internet is the Google connection at the Starbucks 4 miles down the road.



My cell phone internet is my main source of online news, my work connection, hell anything I want to do online I use my cell phone for.

I was sold this plan as "unlimited data". Now when I call to complain I get a response from some lower-middle management person telling me that I'm paying for "unlimited access" and not "unlimited speeds". I call every month that this affects me and ask what is being done. My last call was approx. 2 months ago and I received $10/month for life from my bill. That was only after I spent 1 hour on the phone with 5 different people. (The last rep was extremely helpful and was actually aware of the FCC issues)


I have a single phone with 700 minutes/month, unlimited data and unlimited texting. I pay approx $79~/month (not including cost of phone) for these services and the data alone is $30/month of that bill. I won't switch to another plan because I want what I am paying for. I want what was sold to me, what was advertised to everyone when I signed up for the plan. Until I get it I'm going to continue to whine and complain until this is resolved.

I'm betting that this "free" service will come with a complete harvesting of all of your traffic metrics, preferences, etc. in order to target more advertising at this particular demographic. 

To Google it's cheaper to give away the bandwidth and router and then get paid for selling the advertising for all of those new "assets". By owning the ISP they can monitor your traffic on any site, selling that much more info to their advertising clients.

It's hard not to be a little suspicious about it. I've seen it happen with my iOS and my Android devices. They've gotten much slower with every major upgrade. The companies shouldn't be releasing the upgrades to those devices that will experience a slowdown. This would be an easy thing for Apple to maintain since they have so few devices, but Google could also do it I'm sure with some hardware evaluations.

6268 :: iPhone 4S owners file suit against Apple, claim iOS 9 made phones unb...
Former Genius Bar techie here. Routinely had these complaints even with iOS 8 - it just dragged their poor iPhone 4S devices down to a crawl. Even doing a full restore wouldn't help, and so they'd ask for us to forcibly install the old OS...there was no way in-store for us to do that, it was basically a homebrew thing you'd have to do and the average Joe can't figure that stuff out.

It was especially frustrating for me because people of course would accuse Apple of doing it intentionally to force them to buy a new phone. As an employee, I obviously can't say "Yes that's why" but it's a really plausible case. Apple has to know that pushing these updates to old phones with processors from a 4+ generations earlier is not going to create a positive user experience, which is something their bullshit Credo claims to want to create.

i hate how this article writes off poor optimization and development as "new software is just more complex and runs crappier on older hardware" like its a statement of fact

new software does not always run worse than older software, its actually the case in most instances where the exact opposite happens

for instance windows 10 does run markedly faster on older devices than windows 8 did, same with windows 7 over vista

linux is the clear case, as linux 4+ and distributions based on it run on hardware over a decade old just fucking fine

android kitkat brought performance improvements and lowered the system requirements compared to ICS, which was a disaster in terms  of performance on older handsets

it is not clear cut that new software MUST run slower than old software and it just seems like a shitty excuse to excuse apple from making good on support for old devices

6249 :: The TPP is the Most Brazen Corporate Power Grab in American History: ...
> The economist David Rosnick, in a report on the TPP by the Center for Economic and Policy Research [(CEPR)](http://www.cepr.net/), estimated that under the trade agreement only the top 10 percent of U.S. workers would see their wages increase. Rosnick wrote that the real wages of middle-income U.S. workers (from the 35th percentile to the 80th percentile) would decline under the TPP. 

This is what needs to be mentioned whenever someone says the TPP will lead to an increase in GDP and in general benefits the economy. Yes it will likely lead to growth and yes there are benefits for consumers due to lower prices of products, but most of the benefits are for the wealthiest section of society and most of the negatives are for the weakest. This unequal distribution of the consequences of the TPP will only exacerbate an already problematic level of inequality in the US.

Every time people on reddit break it down, they conclude "it's actually pretty okay", and every time people post articles about it, it's a Faustian deal.

As a non-expert on this topic, I don't know what to think.

I'm coming to the conclusion that what this really means is, this is no worse than all the other terrible deals we already live with. Is that about right?

6252 :: Advertisers admit it: ‘We messed up’ the Web "The systems that allowe...
The rise of ad blockers reminds me of how 10 years ago a big driver of piracy (on top of people just wanting shit for free) was that DRM, companies being slow to adapt to new technology, and similar boneheaded business practices made it so that pirating shit was a much better experience than getting it legally. 

Remember when the only legal way to play some games/music on your PC involved installing copy protection shit that was practically a fucking virus on your computer? Remember when the only legal way to watch anime was to wait 6-12+ months after it aired for the domestic DVD release that was priced at ~$7-10/episode? It's similar with ads- when they're relatively light and unintrusive, they're great, but when they slow down load times, drain battery, or (worst of all) create sound it gets to the point where people consider blocking them. 

You can guilt trip people all you want, but when the experience of giving you money (directly or indirectly) for your content is significantly worse than the experience of "stealing" it, they're going to tell you to get fucked and pirate your shit/block your ads.

Let's assume everyone started using the internet only for email. Would Comcast lower everyone's bills in response? Of course not.

Sorry, that's going to cost extra because all of the people uploading excessively large file attachments over 5Kb are really straining our system!"

They are aren't even trying to disguise their greed, these excuses are nothing less than trolling. They are laughing at the customers because they can, because they know there is no competition.

If that's the case then the throughput of those bits should be unlimited.

6234 :: “The more bits you use, the more you pay”: Comcast CEO justifies data...
I hate reposting but this is such a strict anti-consumer grasp on the internet that some people need to see the stats. 

>If the data cap comes to me (105Mb/s download or 13MB/s) and they impose the 250GB limit then I'm not allowed to use more than 0.7% of my actual data cap (33.696 TB). I pay $101/month for this service.

Math

    60 * 60 * 24 = 86,400 seconds/day
    86,400s * 30d = 2,592,000 seconds/month
    2,592,000s * 13MB = 33,696,000MB (33.696 TB)
    250GB / 33.696TB = 0.00741 (0.7%)

This is fucked.

edit: Folks, this isn't even 1% of my actual data cap. This is **POINT** 7 percent. Tell me that's fair data use.

Edit 2: 
>A cap is a finite amount, when I say "Actual" I mean based on the physical limitations what I could possibly accomplish in a perfect world.
It's understood that you are unable to achieve constant 13MB/s speeds, but I need to set the precedent* of if it were possible as it is. I pay for the maximum possible amount of data I could transfer; 33 Terabytes.
Data caps is an arbitrary number that was once imposed by ISPs as a "Congestion" deterrence. For those who use more data and consume more bandwidth through the pipes to pay more since they are hindering other user's performance.
Though it has been claimed by Comcast that their data caps aren't about freeing up congestion but more for "Fair Usage". They've yet to explain what they mean by "Fair usage". Over time on this subreddit it's been discussed that it's their "tax" against those who cut the cord because of their falling subscriptions for cable boxes.
So with this limitation my "Actual" data cap is now hindered to their arbitrary number for no real purpose to .7%, Now instead of downloading 24/7 at 105Mb/s I can only download at 91KB/s to stay under the cap or I'll have to pay an additional $5 fee on my already $101 monthly bill.
For no reason at all.

6234 :: “The more bits you use, the more you pay”: Comcast CEO justifies data...
Oh, listen to this hilarity: 

> you can instead choose to enroll in the Flexible Data Option to receive a $5 credit on your monthly bill if you reduce your data usage plan to 5 GB. If you choose this option and use 6 GB of data or more in any given month, you will not receive the $5 credit and will be charged an additional $1 for each gigabyte of data used over the 5 GB included in the Flexible Data Option.

So, if you use a measly 5gb of data, we'll give you a 5 dollar CREDIT. So 5 bucks off the 60-100 dollars you're already paying. 

How is this helpful in any way???

If you go over the 5gb... get the lube ready. We're going to charge you 1 dollar for every gig you go over, very potentially charging you way more than if you had just gotten the unlimited data plan for 135. 

FUCK YOU COMCAST. 

I really wish I wasn't in a cap area. It's seriously making me considering moving.

What's great about this particular technique is that ensures that your top employees will leave immediately. Then you get to watch most of the decent ones you have left file out onesie-twosie over the next year or so as they land new jobs. Then you're left with the dregs and whatever desperate souls you can hire who will take a job with no bennies and no future.

My friend, a high-level engineer, was heavily recruited a number of years ago by HP and ended up negotiating something around a six-figure guaranteed severance package.  He says so far they haven't seemed interested in laying him off.  

Moral of the story is, if you're going to take a job with HP, be prepared to look out for yourself.

6223 :: HP told some employees to choose between becoming contractors with no...
I've read the article and read over the comments as well. I see where everyone is coming from by saying its "Perceived value" and such. 

That doesn't stop it from being a shady tactic nonetheless. Basically telling your employees that they either go with option A and do the same job for another company, with different policies, different hours, different pay, and different title (supervisors demoted, etc), or get fired (Option B) and in either way, they lose their PTO, Vacation, Sick Time, etc.... That's really disrespectful to your employee workforce, and ultimately shows what kind of company you are as a whole.

Personally, I see this as a start of HP's down-hill slide. Because as a consumer, I wouldn't purchase their products knowing they only care about the quantity and the money, not the quality. Their employees are a part of that quality. Happy Employees = Happy Consumers. Happy Employees = Great Products. (Most of the time)

I actually am a part of this unfortunate situation as I currently am contracted under Adecco. I got hired on at HP by some connections with my father who is a Systems Architect whom works on the same floor as me. My father has worked at HP for over a decade and over the years, has told me a lot of the unreasonable "Policy Changes." Some of those in which have been laid off without any specific reasoning. Due to privacy reasons I won't specifically state who I support, but I am in fact contracted by Adecco, work at HP's facility, and support employees in a seperate company. 

So far, most of the people on my floor have already started converting to Adecco. I see the direct impact in which this change is affecting a numerous amount of lives. If you weren't hired into Adecco directly, then HP employees were given an option to have a week to sign up in compliance with Adecco or have a week left of work at HP.

It's quite a shame that employees are predominately becoming numbers on a page instead of being recognized for the hard work, friendliness, and dedication that are quickly deteriorating.

[Patent US5675811](https://www.google.com/patents/US5675811) is what is alleged to be infringed upon in [this complaint](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Minero.Complaint.pdf) The allegedly infringing devices being sold are USB 3.0 hubs.

This patent is for connecting multiple devices to a [palmtop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop_PC). USB and Firewire already existed when this patent was filed. Some dummy lawyer looked at the first picture in the patent and saw what looked like a USB hub plugged into a tablet and a keyboard, then thought, "ca-ching!"

The patent filing actually points out that Firewire already accomplishes the same thing (daisy chain-able serial bus hub) but was more complex and costly than the patented design. I could be wrong (an EE would help out here) but USB and this patented device go about the same task in different ways. 

So the patent obviously wasn't intended to cover the concept of serial bus hubs, but rather a very **specific** design spec and protocol for a serial bus hub. 

IMO, this isn't something as vague as most of the software patent lawsuits we've seen in the last decade. At least those lawsuits have government stamped patent that (if valid) is being infringed upon. This is just plain fraud on the parts of the lawyers, as this patent's scope clearly doesn't cover USB.

[Here is a router compatibility list](http://tomato.groov.pl/?page_id=69). If you don't have a router that is there, you can see if you can install dd-wrt on your router, as it's pretty similar. [Here is a list of routers that work with dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices).

627
6182 :: FCC: yes, you're allowed to hack your WiFi router
If the FCC wants to ensure the compliance of wifi radios--whether it be in routers or any other hardware--they should *require radio firmware be open source*.  It's such a brain-dead obvious solution to the problem that a few decades from now people will look back at this time and wonder, "WTF was wrong with these people‽"

Eventually the FCC, NTSB, and copyright laws will all be in alignment on the subject of requiring source be available for compliance and safety inspection.  When that day arrives the media will talk about how long it took to get to that point and politicians will be quoted saying things like, "hindsight is 20/20" after the 1000th horrific recall, disaster, or similar forces their hand.

Don't let them get away with it; I'm saying it *now* and you should too:  **"If we must ensure compliance, safety, or security then open source is the *only* option."**

Don't let anyone ever say that "hindsight is 20/20" on this topic.  I'm probably going to repeat this comment over and over again so that in the future I can say that we warned people of the problems but they *did the wrong thing anyway*.

This was a worthless clickbait article.

Just because something is extremely difficult, or even impossible, doesn't mean people can't desire it. There was nothing in the report that indicated the respondents had to factor in the difficulty involved.

> Hate to jump to the obvious, but a lot of people (I'd wager the majority) would like to "shut down" child abuse. Just because it would be nearly impossible doesn't stop them from wanting it.

They actually *could* deal a crippling blow to TOR if they really wanted to.

* **EDIT**:  While I mention Tor nodes and bitcoin specifically, I'm sure the legislation would be worded to cover all avenues and cryptocurrencies, such as Freenet and I2P which are mentioned in the article, along with ensuring that the legislation would also cover any future technologies as well.

Let's say someone in the US government drafted legislation saying that if you run a TOR node, *you* are responsible for *all data* that passes through it.  Slap all the right buzzwords on it ("protect the children from pedophiles", "fight terrorism", "war on drugs", etc. etc. etc) and give it the right title (the Protect teh childrenz from evil bad people Act") and you have a bill that receives wide bipartisan support from all the "tough on crime" people, which would be political suicide to oppose.

Would it pass a Supreme Court challenge?  Probably not.  But it would still take several years to even get to that point anyway.  During that time, nobody in their right mind is going to risk jail time and a lifetime placement on the sex offender registry just to run a TOR exit node or something, virtually shutting down all the non-government-run exit nodes in the US.  As other countries follow suit (and at least some, like the UK, would), more exit nodes get shut down, slowing the network down to the point of being unviable.  

Add a provision in the bill forbidding banks from dealing with any company that handles Bitcoin (A similar provision forbidding banks from dealing with online poker sites successfully crippled online poker in the US) would be another crippling blow.  You'd see the value of Bitcoin tank overnight since no bank or company would put themselves at risk over a cryptocurrency that would be demonized by the mainstream media ("Bitcoin is what the pedos and druggies and terristz use to commit crimes online") and that only a small fraction of a percent of their customers have even heard about, much less use.

Keep in mind, I'm not saying I support these measures at all.  I'm just saying that while they may not be able to "shut down" the dark net, it would be trivially easy to deal a crippling blow with the right combination of must-pass laws and an easy-to-write smear/FUD campaign targeting the masses who wouldn't know a Bitcoin from a Chuck-E-Cheese token.

Are you sure your reading this correctly? He's pretty much against FCC controlling the internet. But wants to push for all benefits of Net Neutrality. So pretty much. Governement is hands off* (asterik being, companies can't fuck around with the consumer) Keeps the regulations minor and aims to keep it that way.

He's aiming to prevent future bullshit from occurring such as "interent tax" and future regulations that may limit new competitors from springing up (like google fiber). As this happens with other utilities such and electric, water, etc.

6176 :: I emailed my Congressman about the net neutrality killing rider that'...
Congresses lack of meddling has helped the Internet to blossom.  The largest issues we face is almost complete lack of competition in most markets.  The meddeling has occurred at the state and local level.

And that's because you have to bribe your local municipality to offer internet.  Say you wanted to compete against Comcast and run a large pipe to your house and then set up AC wifi throughout your developement and you and your neighbors all pitch in for the monthly bill.  Well, guess what?  You can't.  That's completely illegal.

The local and state municipalities have raised the barrier to entry so high, that unless you're a big cable company, you can't get into the market.

Remember the 90s, when you have dozens of ISPs to choose from?  You know why that existed?  Cause we all got to use regular phone lines that were already there.

If my tax dollars are going to spent on something, I want a 1 GB fiber connection to my door that my township provides.  Then I get to shop for the ISP, TV Provider and phone provider of my choice.  It's really time we started treating the cable in the ground as infrastructure, like we do roads.

6176 :: I emailed my Congressman about the net neutrality killing rider that'...
I worked on the Hill with a vendor that did everything from physical machine installation/configuration, to email/telephone townhall outreach, websites, and data products. One of the other products offered was a constituent relationship manager (just like a customer relationship manager, aka CRM).

Basically, your letter wasn't read, or if it was, it was skimmed/(edit: perused). A legislative aide likely received the message in their normal "bucket" of messages to respond to, saw that it filtered on particular keywords that make it eligible for a particular templates response letter, and so sent you the email you received. The Congressman didn't write that email, although his CoS or press secretary likely got his sign off on it before using it.

Sadly, you won't get a Congressperson's time via email. On a telephone townhall you can get a couple minutes with them to ask a question, maybe even a follow-up, but that is it. You could also travel to DC, book time with the Congressperson's office, and perhaps get a 15m meeting, but that's about all a typical citizen can hope for these days. Their time is valuable, and while the form letter seems like a good idea for them in order to respond to everyone, clearly it fails. That said, keep in mind there aren't that many aides to assist in letter writing, and they receive hundreds or thousands per week.

The US Congress is a business; its business is running the rest of the country so that other smaller corporations can produce products and pay taxes. It isn't an evil scheme, it is just the best system we have at the moment. If you want change, go out and support a candidate with stated policies and a background to match the policies you hold dear. Sure, big money keeps winning in federal elections these days, but with the Internet and technology's vast edge, it won't always.

Yeah, no shit.  The shooter had two phones, one personal and one work phone.  The personal phone, he smashed with a hammer before performing the act.  The work phone was left intact.

Well that's how investigations go. If there had been invaluable information, would we have reconsidered Apple's opposition? I doubt it. I know I would not. So regardless of whether anything was found we are still on Apple's side of the argument, meaning that it did not matter whether they found anything or not. 

The only real difference is that we get to pat ourselves on the back for supporting Apple after they have been vindicated, instead of saying "well they did the right thing anyway".

They knew there would be nothing on it. That was not the point of the exercise at all. Look at the language formed: the idea was, yet again, to scare the public into making a company comply with dubious government demands and weaken their product.

The terrorists are nothing but a very easy and cheap excuse to force compliance. Goering was right all along.
938
6184 :: It turns out there was nothing substantial on the San Bernardino iPho...
I keep having this nagging thought: It was a conspiracy. I haven't ever bought into any conspiracy theories before, but what if:

1. FBI wants into this phone, and thinks they can get in by forcing the OEM (Apple) to hand them the keys. 
2. Apple refuses and files a lawsuit. 
3. FBI's legal council advises that the FBI is likely to lose the suit and, if/when that happens, it will set a precedent preventing them from ever trying again. 
4. Result is "lose the battle to win the war" - FBI drops the suit so they can try again with a case they're more likely to win, with the intent of setting up a series of "stepping stone" precedents to get what they want. 
5. To save face, the FBI claims "a group of hackers" let them into the phone and. . . there wasn't anything on it. 

The encryption bill in Congress isn't making this scenario any less viable for me.

This whole thing has **nothing to do with the phone, or what was on it.** It was about setting a legal precedent to allow the government to "unlock" or gain access to **any phone** of their choosing in future.
76
6184 :: It turns out there was nothing substantial on the San Bernardino iPho...
It was *never* about the terrorist, the phone, or the data that one might have put on the other. It was *always* about wanting *unrestricted* access to *anyone's* secured data if there's an investigation. It has, from the very beginning, been *entirely* about removing the technical barrier that encryption poses.

Strong encryption has long been a cause for concern for law enforcement because it can put any average nobody on par with a major national government or military in terms of data security, and properly secured data is *also* secured against *snooping on the part of law enforcement officers*.

so, i get why the companies didnt want the new def of broadband, but i dont get why they put any effort into fighting it. call it xtrme speeeed net..no one cares, they just want theri videos to not buffer.

It's a common argument that population density is the reason America and Canadia get crappy internet compared to much of the world. That's true for rolling out high speeds to *the entire* population but that argument ends there. Urban population densities are the same for America and Canada when comparing to South Korea and the Netherlands. It's much more likely that lack of competition is the primary factor for these countries.

And their only motivation is their bottom line. And even with competition, it's not like they'd go out of business or anything.

What's old is new and what's new is old. In the late 90s when DSL was the new hotness, I worked for a new phone company (a "CLEC", or "competitive local exchange carrier"). Southwestern Bell was the "ILEC" (or "incumbent LEC"). They pulled shady crap like this all the time.

For instance, we had to file a formal request with them to lease a phone line between a customer and the equipment box. They had something like 45 days to act on it. Inevitably, on day 44 they'd reply that the form was incorrect because their corporate standard was to use a period after the abbreviation "123 Main St." or something stupid like that, and that we had to re-submit the request. No, can't just amend it or be sane! We had to start from scratch.

A few days later, our customer and their neighbors would get a sales call from SWB: "you might've heard that your neighborhood can get DSL. Did you know you can get it from SWB, your trusted and beloved telco, for $10 a month less (for the first 6 months before we drop the discounts)? We can have it installed next week! Or you could wait another 45 days for that silly new company who can't even fill out paperwork, LOL. Or maybe 90 days. Who knows!"

TL;DR do not *ever* take a phone company's complaints or excuses at face value. Ever. They have a long history of looking you straight in the face and flat-out lying.

6159 :: Years Of Pretending Netflix Cord Cutting Wasn't Real Is Biting The Ca...
Of course they know it is real, that is why they kept shoving how we needed bandwidth controls/limits down our throat

I had a neighbor tell me they love Netflix but are afraid to use it and/or get rid of cable as they are worried about going over their limits, and it also costs MORE to just have internet without cable, and being the only provider for the state, a fraction of the state has fios, and nothing else for high speed internet (DSL is a joke, cellular not consistent enough/measly bandwidth limits/expensive for entire home usage), the cable company absolutely knows what they are doing.   But there is a different cable company a state over, so somehow that makes them not monopolies

the cable industry is not stupid, they know there is nothing we can/will do about it, there is absolutely nothing "biting them in the ass"

A simple way to determine if your business model is screwed is to identify which parts of your business model exist purely to screw the customer and are completely unnecessary. The next test is to ask how much markup there is on providing your basic service to a customer.

The third test is how much effort you have to put into lobbying to maintain your position.

In the old music business it was the whole 1 good song on each CD/cassette/album.

In TV it was a variety of things such limited frequencies when antennas ruled, and then bundling good channels with lots of terrible channels so that pretty much anyone would have to subscribe to many bundles to get a handful of channels they wanted. 

Then in the world of cell phones they have the regulators pretty much locked down along with the fact that cellphone services are brutally cheap to deploy (despite their protestations). For instance in many parts of the world unlimited data plans on a 3G network cost a tiny fraction of what they do in North America. 

Long distance would be a perfect example. In Germany when the state telco lost its long distance monopoly the head guy said something like, "Mark my words without our steady hand at the helm long distance will blow through a dollar or two a minute within 5 years." I believe it cracked 5 cents per minute within about a year.

But my all time favourite is that one of the things many people who try netflix say is that they can't go back because they can no longer tolerate commercials. Yet there are cable channels that are speeding up shows so as to fit a few more commercials into them. What?!!!

That all said there are a pile of people who will not bother to switch from cable. I thought my sister was one but the local cable company is dropping the last of the analog. So for her to go digital will drive her bill from 44 to 71. She is dumping cable.

I work at a TV station, I direct half of a 4 1/2 hour morning show, daily, and I don't have cable, neither does my weatherman, or my female anchor (sad when the faces on tv don't want cable anymore).  I'd venture to guess that around 40% of my coworkers have cut the cord.  If this is what people who actually WORK in the industry are doing, you do the math of what's coming down the pike for cable companies.

6159 :: Years Of Pretending Netflix Cord Cutting Wasn't Real Is Biting The Ca...
Everyone I know has either cut the cord, or is strongly considering cutting the cord. This just blows my mind. Because even in 2010 myself and everyone I knew would have NEVER parted with their cable TV.

Call me crazy but people seem to be going outside more? Don't get me wrong, they still sit inside when they want to. But it almost feels like people are snapping out of their zombie TV phase and venturing out for the first time.

For instance in Chicago, biking EXPLODED from "just a hipster thing" to "hey why don't you get a bike?". Our Lakeshore path is growing more and more crowded. We're building dedicated bike lanes etc.

They questioned people after they disconnected from Facebook for a week.

A week? That seems hardly an accurate timeframe.

I quit Facebook earlier this year, and I would say for the first month I felt better. Didn't feel like I was randomly looking at posts that I didn't want to see. Didn't have to worry about the social ramifications of not 'friending' someone, and honestly, I didn't have to read the thoughts of people I knew because I honestly don't want to know what some people think.

But more importantly, my connections with people didn't seem fake, because some people I had many conversations with on Facebook seemed completely distant when I met them in-person. It was like we didn't know each other. 

**But then the new paradigm kicked in after a month or two...**

I realized that I had used Facebook to be social, to meet people, to connect with people, to bitch about life, etc. There really were benefits that I gave up to not have to deal with a lot of the negativity that I found from being on Facebook. 

I'm not going back to Facebook because the negatives outweight the positives, but leaving Facebook left me with the same feeling that I had when I finally realized I wasn't religious and left the church that had felt like home: disconnected. 

So I guess this study really only addresses short-term feelings. Based on my own anecdotal experiences. I'd be interested on the long-term affects, and how people adjust.

Look, Facebook isn't the devil. It's your lack of self-awareness that is the devil. Unless you admit to yourself that you are USING facebook for validation, or to escape or whatever else, then you will abuse it and it will have negative consequences in your life.   
   
There are plenty of people like me, who use FB occasionally, and who genuinely do not give a single FUCK about it, or the opinions of those on it.   
It's just another *thing* that is *there*. Don't make it out to be more than it is.

Forgive my ignorance of the average fb user. I didn't see it from their point of view. My suggestion is if you still have feelings for an ex, dislike Trump and Carson supporters, and hate those click bait stories do the same. A few clicks could well be worth your stress free future.

There's two ways of looking at this:

1) The "request" isn't really a request, and the court is just playing puppet to the government. 

2) The government is only filing requests for cases with watertight proof of why it's necessary. 

Without transparency, we can only hope for option 2 or to violently overthrow the government, you choose.

I've spoken to the folks who make these requests as well as some of the people who approve them. Basically the laws are so clear on most of these issues that normally no one requests to do evil things. Additionally, before the FISA court itself reviews a request there's a whole enormous process of negotiations and planning ahead of time and, if it looks like your request is illegal, the clerks of the FISA court can just suggest revisions informally and often do. The FISA process is long and expensive so no one embarks on it without good lawyers and an airtight case. The only things that get denied are cases that try to set new precedents the court doesn't agree with - everything else is more or less identical to previous cases with the names and organizations mad-libbed out so that no one runs the risk of requesting too much, being denied, and having to start over.

The guy I spoke to also mentioned that he can count the times he got a first draft through the pre-court review process on one hand - mostly because the clerks are "grammar pedants, even compared to most lawyers." The reality is, by the time the judges on the actual court agree to look at anything it has been picked over with a fine-toothed comb by lawyers and clerks on both sides of the table.  It'd be hard to get anything illegal far enough along through that process for the court to deny it.

336
6121 :: The TPP can still be stopped
Ok so I've ACTUALLY opened one of the documents and looked at it.  

 It's basically a spreadsheet of 10,000+ rows with each row specifying a commercial product.   Each row has a column for countries and their agreement for tariffs on said item in row.   So most say no tariff,  but some country columns say like ending tariffs 2 years after the start. 

There is even 3 specific rows for chickens bred for cock fighting.   Which,  thank Lord,  Brunei will lower tariffs in half 4 years after adoption of the TPP , and Vietnam will have 0 tariffs on chickens bred for cock fighting at the start. 

Edit:  So that was kind of a joke to illustrate what the bulk of the thing is.   I mean Brunei has a tariff schedule for fighting cocks.   And should point there are free to import in Brunei.     But Australia doesn't have Fighting Cocks as a tariff item.   But it does have an item for dolphins which luckily will be tariff free in Australia.

And the rest of the agreement is actually pretty good, and it would be stupid for us to reject it.

Do they really want to cover all communication? What about mail, carrier pidgeons, handheld radios or neighborhood light signals. I'm not sure about normal mail, but my guess is that law enforcement has a very hard time monitoring all possible communications. A hand radio on a 'forbidden' frequency could very easily be used for long distance communication, and impossible to track if they change the frequency regularly.

Software architect in cryptography space here. What infuriates me is this James Comey fella- is not a computer scientist. Hes a lawyer, rendering him ignorant, incompetent and inadequate to push for policies such as this. I love america. Where matters of science, health, economics, EVERYTHING. All decided by fucking lawyers.

Anyways- what has me has me so deeply bothered by this is that it is not possible to implement. Period. There are two primary types of encryption you use in your every day life symmetric and asymmetric. Each has various properties which make them better suited in different applications. Now each type is composed of various algorithms again, different properties for different applications. What is extremely important is that the implementations all are based on mathematical proofs. Some proofs are simply unsolved problems which could yield a solution one- while others provide direct or probabilistic proof. That said it is simply not possible to implement a "backdoor" without compromising the mathematical proofs. A backdoor for bad guys that work for the government means backdoors for everyone. The methods for using this tool against people would be known by the "bad guys" before it was even fully implemented. I'm completely skipping over all of the possible implementations the government could aim for.. some would be harder to compromise than others.. but at the end of the day it doesn't matter man, the data is compromised. All of it.

**It's like the government saying: Anyone who thinks of a number that is added to 7 must be known by the government. So from here on out- any number +7 shall equal 56. This is a matter of national security.**

Sweet. No everyone knows 7 + N is 56.. Scumbag Steve will be there to fuck you. All the law abiding citizens will be using shitty broken crypto putting their livelihood at risk for an over reaching government. Meanwhile non law abiding citizens will continue to use strong encryption. People like me- who would prefer to not go to prison and are non violent contributing members of society would become non-law abiding citizens as I would under no circumstance change my home infrastructure and compromise my livelihood.

I am slowly growing tired of this country and the reality is I grow closer to pursuit of a new place to call home every month. Maybe Bernie will have the opportunity to give me new hope.

This enrages me.. **"Apple's “unilateral decision” to encrypt iPhones will harm American national security by allowing “homegrown violent extremists and terrorists to communicate with each other, to send messages without law enforcement being able to identify what they’re saying,” Vance argued last year."**

I am not sure which of the following two possibilities is more terrifying to me 1) They actually believe that making encryption illegal will "help combat terrorists". Or 2) I have a government whom uses fear mongering through the "terrorism" and "extremists" keywords to violate the privacy and security of their citizens.

I can't imagine they are stupid enough for #1.. the current implementations of cryptography are immortalized and will be available forever. They would have to go to every home and collect old hard drives searching for "unapproved" encryption algorithms. They would have to prevent USB hard drives from being shipped from over seas. They would have to ease drop over every torrent downloaded.. Really? Get real man. Encryption is out there and it isn't going anywhere. Those whom plan to commit an act of terror will have easy access to encryption if they choose to use it. It's only the citizens who lose. I' would like to think they know that.

TL;DR

Foreign hackers took private government worker info. This included humiliating polygraph tests, past abuses, debts, etc. Information going back to even 30 years of someone's life. Now these hackers have *huge* leverage over many government workers. Up to 18 million people could be affected.

The hackers were (probably) Chinese. This was the most successful hack against the US ever.

Rogue nation tells Jenkins, we'll tell your wife about your secrets, or we'll pay off your debt so she'll never know if you pass on a couple files to us. Jenkins, with a lot to lose, passes on a couple "harmless" files. Repeat with all the Jenkins's and you can get a lot of information about another nation.

That article has a link to a freaking *incredible* look into how the security clearances are rejected or denied [here.](http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/industrial/2015.html)  It looks like most people denied clearances are denied due to financial troubles.  I can kind of understand of that.  Someone with financial issues is at a higher risk for taking money.  What really blows my mind are the number of people denied for marijuana usage.  The other really common one is "foreign influences" or "foreign preference".  Basically, if you think any other country is cool, you are out.  If you have a lot of contact with people in a foreign country (like family), you are out.  Marijuana, foreign influences, and finical issues make up pretty much all of the rejects in the list.

A few choice ones I found:

* *Applicant is a 36-year-old accountant with a history of illegal drug involvement consisting of using and buying marijuana during the years of 1996 2013. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02947.h1

*  Applicant falsified his 2013 security clearance application. He used marijuana in 2011 while holding a security clearance. He has not mitigated the security concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02696.h1

*  Applicant has a close and continuing relationship with his family in India. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-04993.h1

*  Applicant has used marijuana for about 34 years and intends to use it in the future. He was also less than candid about his usage in 1991 and 2002 on Questionnaires, and in a 1992 interview. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02491.h1

*  Applicant is 53 years old and is employed as an Aerospace Engineer for a defense contractor. His foreign preference for Germany could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-05457.h1

*  Applicant is a native of Israel and a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has surrendered his Israeli passport to his facility security officer. His spouse and children are native-born U.S. citizens. His mother and brother are citizens and residents of Israel. His daughter recently moved to Israel, became an Israeli citizen, and joined the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). His brother is a citizen and resident of Israel, retired from the IDF after 20 years of service. Foreign preference concerns are mitigated, but foreign influence concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. CASE NO: 14-02496.h1

*  Applicant used marijuana sporadically between July 1998 and August 2013. He did not present information sufficient to mitigate the security concerns about his drug use. His request for a security clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02674.h1

**And a couple of really amazing ones that makes you wonder WTF ones**

*  Applicant is 40 years old. While serving as a police officer, both on-duty in uniform and off-duty, he engaged in sexual intercourse on four occasions with prostitutes. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline D, sexual behavior. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-03638.h1

*  Applicant owes approximately $105,000 in delinquent debt, including almost $75,000 in child support. He is on probation after serving three years in prison for attempting to commit illegal sexual contact, enticing a minor by computer, and violating a condition of release in July 2008. Clearance is denied. CASE NO: 14-02059.h1

*  In 2010, Applicant was charged with various violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and convicted by a Special Court-Martial of two violations of Article 121, UCMJ. He was sentenced to 85 days confinement, reduction from E-7 to E-5, ordered to forfeit $1,500, and fined $3,800. When asked on his e-QIP about any police record, he lied. Applicant also had substantial delinquent debts, totaling approximately $31,546 that had been placed for collection or charged off. Yet, when asked on the same e-QIP about his financial record, Applicant again lied. He subsequently admitted falsifying his responses. He offered no explanation for his falsifications. There are some indications that Applicant�s financial problems are not under control and he may simply file for bankruptcy to avoid paying his delinquent debts. Applicant�s actions under the circumstances cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Eligibility is denied. CASE NO: 14-01506.h1

*  Applicant is 36 years old. He was arrested numerous times and was convicted of domestic violence, driving under the influence, obstructing government operations and running a stop sign. He had numerous criminal offenses nolle prossed. He was acquitted of a drug trafficking charge and had another drug charge overturned on appeal. It has been six years since his last arrest. Applicant provided considerable rehabilitation evidence. He has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline H, drug involvement. **Clearance is granted**. CASE NO: 14-01845.h1

Well there's your problem.

Try sending hardcopy letters. In fact, you can have them bundled and sent the same day as the protest you arrange.

So essentially, you'll have a hundred thousand letters delivered on the same day to an office and you can have a significant amount of people standing outside.

In essence, they would have to be blind to ignore your message.

Yes, their fax system cannot handle 6,000 faxes - sent as faxes rather than anything else to prove a point about how far behind the government metaphorically is.

But I hope they don't spend time, energy, and money, upgrading a fax system to handle a volume that is only created by a group staging a protest.

Next time, send it via the channel that replaced the fax machines you're complaining about: e-mail.

The office of the SAA confirmed they were not recieveing the fax calls from area code 612? That means either they were lying or the problem is not in the senate system, but in the phone company.

I just had a huge argument about this with my parents, who are both computer scientists with advanced degrees. These are two people who have spent their lives using computers and have full comprehension of the level of security we lose when we give up our rights. They should be virulently against this CISA bullshit, but they aren't.


My mothers argument in support of this basically consists of "well nobody cares about privacy anyway with all the personal stuff they post on Facebook" followed by the assertion that "terrorists" are using encryption. Hypothetical examples (asserted to be the truth about non-specifics) were given, and when asked for proof she got angry and basically fell back on the "but but but the terrorist!". 


My fathers argument was more nuanced and he agreed that companies should not be able to share info, but he then proceeded to go off on how "no encryption is uncrackable" and the "it's like a lock" explanation. Then he fell back to the terrorist bullshit.

What has happened to this country where people with doctorates are being brainwashed into fearing terrorists? I tried to explain that the threat of terrorism is immensely overblown, they don't believe me. 


If these two people can be convinced I fear we lost this battle, because while my parents won't be around in 20 years to enjoy the surveillance state they built, I will. We will. Education isn't enough, we need some kind of anti-indoctrination process to remove societies mental illness of constantly fearing "terrerisssts".


We're fucked.

6083 :: End of roaming charges, net neutrality becomes law in EU
The end of roaming charges is a huge step forward.

But, the "net neutrality becomes law in EU" part of the title is wrong, what happened is actually the exact opposite of that. A huge step backwards and de facto abolition of net neutrality in the EU.

The new rules kill net neutrality by creating fast lanes called "specialized services". Now ISPs are free to discriminate content/service providers, requiring extra fees for the fast lane while slowing down everything else.

It is a quite clever word play on their part. Since everyone was against the separation of fast/slow lanes on the internet they renamed it so the fast lanes are now called "specialized services" while only the slow lanes are called "internet".
83
6083 :: End of roaming charges, net neutrality becomes law in EU
This may be good news for some countries, but in the Netherlands we just got screwed out of our real net neutrality. This new law will override the one thing our government actually did right in the past few years and allow for internet providers to throttle again, in exchange for lower data charges abroad - if it ever even comes to that, phone companies don't seem particularly happy with it *and* have loads of money.

In other words, not upgrading your infrastructure to match the bandwidth you sell is a reason to throttle users.
933
6083 :: End of roaming charges, net neutrality becomes law in EU
Regarding roaming: the providers are not prevented from reestablishing their margins by means of creative fees. If not rigorously prohibited by the new law, they will.

Regarding net-neutrality: the proposed "laws" allow for splitting "the internet" into several internets running over the same infrastructure. The "open internet" they call, is the one with no throttling and filtering except for certain cases, BUT this law clearly states and acknowledges "the need" for a second/faster lane for certain services. (My guess: streaming, voip and other low latency 'services' which will be asked to pay up, because they hurt the biz of big telkos in the EU)

Please don't buy into this kind of polito-marketing rhetoric borderline on euphemistic lying.

Neither the current _roaming_ nor the _neutrality_ law proposition is a (big) win for the public, currently more so a huge, frank telko lobbying win (more so in the case of net-neutrality)

I think this movement would have a *lot* more success if people were clearer that they're unhappy with reddit as an entire company, no matter who's the CEO. Because that strikes me as the real problem: the *entire company* doesn't give a shit about redditors, and it might well be policy. It's not like Pao did this by herself. People are confusing the fact that they don't like her for the fact that she's the one to blame. Pao is a symptom, not the cause.

We should be calling for a culture change, not just a CEO change. You put a different person at the top and things are going to run very much the same way. And if you frame the discussion as a culture change, they can't shut you down by saying you're sexist or anything like that (and believe me, that response is already coming). If you guys care about the issue, you need to go beyond Pao.

Edit: I should make it clear that I'm not saying Eric the Intern hates redditors, or even your average employee. I'm just saying if you want to change the way Reddit operates, you have to make it clear that this goes further than Pao; it extends to how the company conducts its business with users in virtually any case. That means the message has to be heard and understood by all of the higher-ups, and not just Pao. Because I'm sure those folks are kicking back and saying "Man, I'm glad I'm not Pao! Those redditors are vicious!" while changing exactly nothing. They need to feel it too if this thing is to be taken seriously.

It's terrible, but it's true.  Most people buy into the statement "I've done nothing wrong, so I've got nothing to hide."  They don't think beyond their next meal, so the idea that surveillance inhibits the freedom to dissent isn't within their sphere of concern.

6050 :: Why isn't NSA mass surveillance a hot topic in the US elections?
To some extent a lot of people still believe that people afraid of mass surveillance are still just conspiracy theory loonies.  So much went into discrediting people with these fears for so long that even now with concrete proof of mass spying people still don't believe or they don't believe it affects them.

6050 :: Why isn't NSA mass surveillance a hot topic in the US elections?
Because Reddit does not reflect the US population.  This is why links about illegal immigration and the economy don't make the front page of reddit. Conversely no candidate is going to talk about the new Star Wars trailer that came out or much time, if any, on pot legalization.

A lot of reasons. Ask people what is the most important issue to them and privacy is not on the list. They want a house over their head and a job to make sure they can keep it.

"Apple have received a patent for a technology that could allow the police to disable protesters smartphones, it has emerged.

The new technology would act as a 'kill switch' for smartphones, disabling any cameras on the devices and blocking their connection to mobile networks.

Apple stresses that the function would be most likely used to prevent copyright theft, such as in cinemas, or to stop phone cameras being used in inappropriate places, like department store changing rooms.

However, in the filing for U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, the company adds that 'covert police or government operations may require complete "blackout" conditions'."

So... How long till it is illegal for a technology company to provide cameras and other equipment that the government cannot deactivate at a moments notice during a protest of Hillary Clinton wanting to pass the TPP? 

Or Trump violating civil rights of Muslims

Or Obama prosecuting whistle-blowers,

what about torture? what about war with Russia in Syria? What about Operation Choke-point?

I am really biased because I build mobile websites but I very much prefer them to apps. You avoid giving an app permission to everything and in the case of Facebook on the mobile website you can use messenger. I just added it to my homescreen.

Also saw a noticeable difference after removing Facebook.

I highly doubt they will ever get awesome performance out of the app since they are so intent on doing all sorts of crazy syncing in the back ground to spy on you. Lots of overhead there
1512
6016 :: Uninstalling Android's Facebook app made a bigger improvement than I ...
No wonder. All of Facebook's apps, including Messenger and Instagram, insist on ignoring Android's built-in push messaging service (GCM) and rolling their own.

This means a separate, persistent socket connection for each of them. All of those connections have to periodically send ping messages to check if they still work and reconnect if they have been disconnected for any reason.

Leaving the house, switching from Wi-Fi to mobile internet or vice versa? Each of those connections has to be reestablished, every single time.

Of course, all those connections are maintained by services that require ~40 MB of memory all the time. When there is not enough memory available, Android will kill and restart those services... Which wastes a ton of battery and, again, requires a reconnection for each of them.

Incredulously, the only exception is WhatsApp, which properly uses GCM (provided it is available and working correctly). If GCM good enough for the most widely used messaging app in the world, why does Facebook insist on ruining everybody's battery life with every other app they are offering?

I am regularly checking each and every app on my phone for that kind of behavior by sniffing all network traffic over my Wi-Fi connection. Facebook's apps are the only three that do it like this. All other apps, including all messengers like Signal, Hangouts, Threema, Slack and Line, which arguably depend most on working push messages, manage to get by just fine using GCM.

Even if there is some rational reason for the way they are doing it, why not multiplex all Facebook push messages through a single service? Why does it have to be replicated across ALL of their apps? I really don't get it.
151
6016 :: Uninstalling Android's Facebook app made a bigger improvement than I ...
YMMV, but I disabled both apps, installed Metal, and on top of my phone (HTC Desire 510) being much more responsive, my battery lasts another entire day, mostly due to the fact that standby power use has become basically nothing compared to what it was, for instance where I'd lose about 15-20% overnight, it's now 2-4%.

You prevent corruption by constructing a system in which it can't flourish. Allowing the governing body access to everything from trade secrets to private e-mails is the ***exact*** opposite of that. Even if the government of today was morally infallible and could be trusted completely with everyones information, we don't know that the government of tomorrow will be trustworthy as well. That is the point of restricting their reach. Because a corrupt out of control government is a real thing that happens in the world all the time and america is not immune to it.

>“Agencies today make far more laws than legislators. But unlike courts and legislators, regulators conduct their deliberations in relative obscurity, often outside of the public’s view and effectively accountable to no one, not even the president,” according to Bush’s proposal.

>Other regulations that would be on the chopping block under Bush’s plan are the administration’s carbon and coal ash rules and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations.

No idea what these are I assume they have a positive effect on the environment and financial markets if his urge to get rid of net neutrality is any indicator.

>In addition, he would put a new regulatory freeze on agencies until one of his appointees approved new rules. He would also set a regulation budget, requiring offsets if new regulations bring costs. He would also pass an executive order outlining principles regulators should follow, including a preference for state action and “honest” cost-benefit analysis.

There seems to be something wrong with Democracy, when a leader can be elected on a handful of policies - usually of temporary and largely manufactured popularity - then go about removing those of the previously elected leader, regardless of how popular those previous policies may still be.

This is the problem modern countries face these days. Governments get into power based on whatever the media turns into an issue at the time, regardless of what's important to the people, then does a bunch of stuff the media ignores even though those things are probably also important to the people.

I don't know who is failing most - the media, Democracy or the majority of voters who swallow whatever either of them say without question. Seriously, the way we are governed these days is a complete joke. Or would be if it were funny.

At&t should have been upgrading their infrastructure for decades, even going so far as to accept public tax dollars to subsidize their ability to do so. Instead, they decided they could pocket the money, do nothing, and when demand began to overwhelm the amount of T1 connection they have had, they decided to throttle everyone and implement caps to double down on the profit. 

Hell they have been sitting on a bunch of 'dark fiber' in cities across the country since the 90s and have done nothing with it because implementing fiber would make their immoral cap system null.

It's just wrong and it's holding back the technological progression of our country and our species

You know, if we just formed angry mobs, and burned down AT&T's offices and data centers around the nation, we could do something about this.

Forming angry mobs to burn things down is my solution to many things.

When I went to get internet for my apartment, the first hing I asked was "Is there a cap?". They said yes and I said "oh ok, no thank you." at which point they went int oa very lengthy (and scripted) explanation how I would never reach that cap even if I was streaming on 4 devices and blah blah blah and when he was done I asked "Yeah but then WHY is there a cap", and he just kept saying I would never hit it.

6016 :: No, Hillary, Edward Snowden Didn't Have Whistleblower Protections
This part of her talking points really bothered me. As many as 5 people (according to the PBS Frontline piece 'United States of Secrets') tried to use official channels, and wanted whistleblower protections. [One was prosecuted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/checkpoint-washington/post/prosecution-of-ex-nsa-official-thomas-drake-was-ill-considered-former-agency-spokesman-acknowledges/2012/03/12/gIQAXE6L7R_blog.html) in retaliation.

What bothers me isn't that she didn't know, she absolutely knows this argument. What bothers me is the same thing that always bothers me with Hilary Clinton; she knows the truth, but chooses the politically expedient.

**Edit**: Since this blew up, I'm going to add something; I don't hate Hilary Clinton, and there's a fair bit of hate below me. I actually believe Hilary Clinton is a good person that genuinely wants to help people, but believes that politics demand couching your idealism in the language of PR and focus groups. Well, that's not true anymore. And it was only true during the TV News era. That era is over, the internet has seen to it. All the great presidents before that era faced circumstances where they had to persuade the public toward a cause they didn't support at the time (Lincoln, FDR, Kennedy, and others). Politics is not, and was never, about telling people what polls say they want to hear--that's not leadership. Politics is about introducing people to new ideas that move us forward, and persuading them to come to the table.

I thought that was one of Hillary's worst answers.  It's not like there haven't been documentaries of what happens to people who make waves in the NSA.   Previously, the NSA handled this kind of thing by getting retroactive approval for them and savaging people's careers. 

I can tell you what doesn't happen though; those people are not kept around classified data and they certainly aren't allowed to discuss them and that's the big point.  Without Snowden acting as he did we NEVER would have known, or suspicious confirmed, that the US gov't was indiscriminately  bulk snooping and storing pretty everyone's info about everything indefinitely

6016 :: No, Hillary, Edward Snowden Didn't Have Whistleblower Protections
The government required training on this stuff is ridiculous. On one hand they give you the whistleblower protection act and tell you its okay, you're helping, etc. Then they have information security training where they threaten you up and down, making it clear that if you leak anything they don't like (which is pretty much everything) you're ass is grass. As an government employee I genuinely feel there is zero protections for whistleblowing right now, regardless of how important the information might be to the public. All the government has to do is say the info you released was a threat to national security, which has no actual metric apparently, and you're done.

6006 :: Microsoft has confirmed that they are downloading Windows 10 to users...
I'm in a rural area where all I can get is verizon home broadband which costs me about $400/mo for 30GB.  Last month I went over my cap due to leaving my laptop on all night.  I woke up the next morning with several text messages saying you have hit 90%...you have hit 100%...you have gone over by 1GB, etc...  It took me a while to figure out that my windows 7 laptop decided to download windows 10 without me "reserving" it.  This combined with my me not realizing that my PS4 would download game updates while in power save mode really cost me last month.

EDIT: Since this comment blew up like it did, I feel obligated to correct my statement and say my normal monthly bill is just over $300.  Last month I paid over $400 due to going over my cap by 5-6 gigs.

EDIT 2:  To keep so many comments from coming in I want to state that yes the PS4 updating was my fault and have since turned off network connectivity while in rest mode.  To those of you suggesting a satellite ISP, yes I have looked into it and I can get it for cheaper but due to the latency in satellite internet I would not be able to play online games.

It's ridiculous and I couldn't believe it when I realized the scale of people it is affecting

So can somebody help me with this?  I'm a bit less than tech savvy but not a complete idiot.  I keep getting messages asking if I want to upgrade to 10 and always say no for a bunch of reasons but the most important being that I work from home and the software I use isn't compatible with 10.  If 10 gets installed, I can't work.  I also don't want a bunch of garbage lurking on my computer.  How do I make sure this hasn't been auto-downloaded to my computer already and how do I keep it from happening if it hasn't already?

Edit: Gotta love that logic though, more people are moving from cable TV because the service is a shitty outdated concept and rather than working to improve the system by either offering channel only subscriptions  to cable or better yet making it all digital streaming as part of your internet package they decide to simply raise the cost of using internet.

6013 :: Comcast’s brilliant plan to make you accept data caps: Refuse to admi...
As someone who currently lives with their bullshit shit data cap, here is what will happen to your "typical family".  Married with 1 school age kid.  We have netflix, crunchyroll and funimation (don't ask, someone in this house refuses to "read cartoons" but watches foreign language films constantly.), a desktop computer, a laptop computer, kid's tablet and 2 smart phones. I am currently the only gamer in the house. According to comcast we should never go above 250GB of data per month using their little "calculate your use" tool set to the highest settings possible.  We regularly hit 450-500.  At 10 bucks every 50GB our bill is generally 30-40$ in addition to the highest home plan they offer. If I get a new game or my kiddo has a school project, forget it, we will be paying 50+ extra a month.  

The "average family" will have internet bills that are $50+ dollars a month higher than they do now.  Grandma won't see an increase but if you are a heavy user or are an "average family", get ready to bend over as Comcast rolls this out nationwide.  Filing complaints won't change a thing other than waste an hour of your time every month yelling at some schmuck in a call center who can't/won't do a damn thing for you.  Until your state and county stop sucking on the nipple of Comcast you won't have options to take your money elsewhere unless you want to fall back to the days of dialup.  So prep your lube and hope you can find money in the family budget. Welcome to the new internet.

I keep thinking back to the 'early days' when dial-up started becoming a household luxury and companies like AOL had plans where you'd get a set limit of minutes then pay exorbitant fees for overages. Everyone hated that and found ways to game the system so the companies finally made unlimited usage plans. And now we're moving back to the caps?

Comcast is building a second tower in downtown Philadelphia and they're complaining that they don't have the money to upgrade their network to provide their customers with a quality service?

Come on, man.

One of them, the current leader, was even Chairman of one of our past major ISPs at one stage in his career so it seemed reasonable. 

Turns out the real plan was to sell us out to their mates at the incumbent telco and interests at News Corp, both of which share a duopoly over pay TV as well as wholesale phone services here. They are currently making billions out of the deal meanwhile we're still dealing with a [crappy copper network held together by plastic shopping bags](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/28/telstra-network-held-together-plastic-bags).

One idea is that if it's legally allowed, open source the code and public data for the tasks that are critical. Make it easy for mirrors to be put up. However I don't know if the mirrors would be clean (they could be used to spread malware to tarnish your reputation) or stay clean. Also whether mirror webmasters have the legal prowess to back the tool.

If it is a short-term action-oriented site, then the guys at EFF should be able to help you out best. Call them up.

It could be that it "looks" like a spam site with so many links vs content. This is a common trick used by SEO optimising scammers (using hundreds of these sites to increase the link count). 

So just guessing here, can you move the list of links to a separate page? Keep your content clear of your partner organisation address? Though I'm not entirely sure that will help. 

Better if you could increase your content to link ratio. I think this is most likely your issue. A page with a few dozen words and 500 links looks very much like a spam site. 

Just a few thoughts.

I hear the same old argument over and over with this stuff. 'This isnt about getting into John q public's phone, this is about public safety and getting into criminals phones'.  I remember a quote to the effect of when a country has too many laws, everyone is a criminal. That leads to a very paranoid group of citizens. 

There's just so many things that can get you into trouble, like drug abuse. Maybe you get klonopins from a friend. Not a lot, but not legally, because maybe you don't have insurance or something. All of a sudden, you're not a person with a legitimate mental illness, addiction, that needs help and treatment, you're a criminal who will spend time in jail or on probation, spend thousands in fines, and be branded for life. 

Maybe if the solution to some of our problems wasn't a heavy handed, put em in jail and disrupt their lives, type of approach, people wouldn't be so paranoid about helping the government find a deal with our actual threats. Like people fucking bombing and shooting up our public places.

5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
Here is a good article from the IDA regarding the problems of LED lighting for streets.

http://darksky.org/citizens-push-back-on-led-lighting/

Its not that they are LED, its that they are the wrong color temperature.

Edit:Some of you are asking about the importance of color temperature.

The short answer is that cooler color temperatures are more disruptive of our circadian rhythms.  It's not just humans that are affected either.  

There was a great documentary called [the city dark](http://www.pbs.org/pov/citydark/) that was released a few years back.  The film goes into greater detail about the effects of light pollution.  

I enjoyed the film although there were a few claims I was skeptical about. 
1077
5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
How is this a surprise? Cheaper, more efficient lighting = more lighting.

The only way that light pollution will be taken care of is if it becomes part of the design agenda. We could optimize our wavelengths for better restfulness, but then driving visibility would decrease at night.

We could provide more aimed reflectors, but then we couldn't spot that deer off the side of the road as well...

It is all trade-offs.
2582
5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
For once my profession is relevant, I have done large scale sales with CREE lighting (LED's). 

LED lighting usually delivers more lumens. The problem is not with the LED lighting itself, its with how the light throws the lumens. This is called directional lighting. We can now aim where we are throwing light by the configuration of the fixture and amount of LED's in it.  You can literally throw out a 90 Degree angle of light at a corner of a street. The problem being, the more technical, the higher the cost. Over time this will go down. We need to make sure we are aiming light only towards the ground (Obvoiusly some will still rebound no matter what), and cut out what's "Spilling" up into the sky.

Edit: Here's an example where light won't spill up:

http://www.cree.com/Lighting/Products/Outdoor/Streetlights/LEDway-Streetlights


Compare that to your average street light, you can see where the spill occurs.

5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
Ahh. As a person who worked for 2 years, during my studies in university, with LED application in street illumination, this article angers me a bit.

The problem is not he LEDs themselves, it's non-educated and non listening government officials. Blue light is not recommended to be used at night (that's why apps like f.lux exist). Blue light at night destroys our perception of day/night cycle. And what do the city governments do when you give them official recommendations of what kind LEDs (what kind of arrangement, what kind of power, spectral distribution they should have, etc.,) they must use? They say that "it's bad light", buy the most cheapest china LEDs which say that have the most lumens (which usually means lots of blue light) and say "that's how street lighting should look like". Then every street is bright blue and after few years china crap quality starts to show.. Pure ignorance from them, complete rage from me..
24
5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
This is only going to get a lot worse in terms of light pollution. The newest line of LEDs are very efficient cost effective. More cities will be racing to replace them. Maybe better design of light housings will help?  
259
5960 :: Astronauts report LED lighting is making light pollution worse
Pretty sure this has more to do with brightness and color temperature than the fact that they're LED's. The lamp in my room has a nice warm yellow with a lower temperature than any of the incandescents in our house. Dunno if this is just filtration (which is a waste of energy) or if the diodes are being tuned, but I think Milan and other cities that transitioned to LED's so early jumped the gun.

Now there are going to be hordes of technology-illiterate constituents who are going to blame the technology for a problem caused by the city's lack of foresight and research. Of course bluer, brighter lighting is bad, but warmer and softer LED's were coming around at that time. Could've waited.

The second photograph looks like its both a higher resolution, and focused better on the subject. this seems to be making the photo look worse. The light is also a different colour.

We don't need photographs from space to know if any city is putting out more light. The city should know what lamps it is using, and their output and locations and should be able to give you a lumens/m^2 figure with fairly little work if they have a digital inventory of what is where.

The pirate movie industry is probably salivating over this. While the box itself might prevent a direct capture of the data, they won't have to deal with noisy theaters or other patrons moving about. They can do high quality, 4k cams in perfectly controlled conditions. $150 + $50 to be able to sell a near bluray rip of The Force Awakens on release day for $20 a pop? They'll jump at that! 
410
5952 :: Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams 'back' Napster founder'...
My first thought on this is that theater owners will NOT like this.  They don't make much money from the movie itself rather they make their money from the concessions.  This will split the money differently (amongst Netflix, etc, and the studios) and ultimately be the downfall of the traditional movie theater experience.

frankly it seems like a last ditch effort to capture revenue lost to torrenting/streaming.

they know a big part of the appeal to torrents is the ability to watch them in the privacy of your own home for free. if they can offer the same convince at a compromised price, cutting out the theaters, they can turn lost money into something. with the popularity of "home theaters" it's not that far of a stretch to see/hear hollywood trying to capitalize on it (beyond existing pay-per-view or on demand).
64
5952 :: Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams 'back' Napster founder'...
Quote from the article, emphasis mine.

>Parker’s venture would offer movies for **$50 (£35)** in the US, with as much as **$20 going to compensate theatrical distributors for their potential losses**. Subscribers would also be offered two free tickets to see their purchased movie a second time on the big screen, with the aim of boosting cinemas’ concessions trade.

>Variety previously reported “serious interest” in Screening Room from studios Universal, Fox and Sony, as well as major US cinema chain AMC. The service will be available on a **$150 set-top box** fitted with anti-piracy technology, but Parker has yet to explain how this will work.

If the price wasn't so ridiculous, I would be very interested.  I suppose they are expecting families/large groups to watch a movie, therefore missing out on 4+ tickets.  What about when my wife and I want to watch a movie? I am supposed to pay more than already-jacked-up city prices to watch the movie at home?

Then I am supposed to pay the equivalent of 10 tickets for the box? And what is this mention of "subscribers"? So there will be some kind of subscription fee as well I presume.  

Maybe I am just not the demographic they are targeting, but this sounds like an atrocious deal.  It is really sad because I would much rather watch a movie in the comfort of my own home, as I typically do now. I guess I will continue waiting for the blu rays to come out.



16
5952 :: Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams 'back' Napster founder'...
Something about this seems off to me and I'm not sure exactly why. Making movies available on the day of release across multiple formats makes perfect sense and I would use it if priced right. Alot of people are saying things like  "I'd pay $50 for my family of four to watch a movie costs more to go to the cinema" I think that way of thinking makes sense when it's just an idea that doesn't mean spending money but becomes very different in reality. Going to the cinema is an event and sure it's too expensive but it's an experience. Huge screen amazing sound the atmosphere of watching a movie for the first time with others who haven't seen it either. Who would actually think $100 to watch 2 movies in there own home is good value? , sure its abit more convenient but after the first time novelty wears off I can't imagine people would stick with it. $50 dollars a month to watch all movies released the previous month makes more sense to me while allowing traditional movies theatres to do their thing, introverts to do their thing and movie producers earn millions.

5952 :: Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams 'back' Napster founder'...
It occurs to me that this is attempting to capitalize on the notion of "now" in our culture. For me, summer blockbuster movies are available when Amazon VOD gets them in winter. My "now" is shifted from the "now" of people who watch movies in theaters.

I can usually buy(\*) a digital version of a movie for about $15 instead of renting it, as long as I'm content to wait a few months. I don't see paying a $35 fee just to see it sooner and not own(\*) it.

(*) as long as Amazon decides I can have access to it, that is

This is just another product of the trend of explaining away constitutional limitations of government in hopes of "progressing" toward a safer and more secure society.

That is appalling. This should not even be possible, especially with a company as big as Amazon.

This *really* pisses me off. I'm an Amazon devotee and purchase everything I need from them, even basic items, clothing, toiletries, luxury items (flat-screen, treadmill), etc. But this scares the shit out of me. 

I've always *loved* their customer service, they've re-sent me items if I don't get them without asking for any proof of it or anything. Which I love. They give you the customer the benefit of the doubt.

I've kind of abused this in that my George Foreman grill was a day late after the delivery date and they sent me another one, now have two George Foreman grills because the other showed up and I didn't send it back.

But maybe when it comes to getting personal details they shouldn't give you that benefit.

**Tell the FCC what you think of these new rules here:** https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/06/2015-18402/equipment-authorization-and-electronic-labeling-for-wireless-devices

Anyone from any country can provide comments, they want to hear from individuals outside the United a states as well! 


1. Go to the Federal Register and press "Submit a formal comment"
2. Start your comment by respectfully asking the FCC to not implement rules that take away the ability of users to install the software of their choosing on their computing devices.

3. Additional points of emphasis you should consider adding:

* Wireless networking research depends on the ability of researchers to investigate and modify their devices.

* Americans need the ability to fix security holes in their devices when the manufacturer chooses to not do so.

* Users have in the past fixed serious bugs in their wifi drivers, which would be banned under the NPRM.

* Billions of dollars of commerce, such as secure wifi vendors, retail hotspot vendors, depends on the ability of users and companies to install the software of their choosing.

* Mesh networking which helps first responders in emergencies, also helps provide anonymity, creates a backup/alternative communications network, will become more difficult than it needs to be with these new rules.

* Users should be able to manipulate and control all aspects of their devices.

* The ability to run fully open source software on your devices will be severely hampered and possibly impossible with these new rules.  

* These new rules will make it extremely difficult if not illegal, to make an open source baseband for cellphones to prevent rogue towers like Stingrays. It will also harm any attempts to build open source cell towers and systems.

This is kinda fucking absurd.  Either the title is misleading or the article is wrong.  

The FCC doesn't give a shit about custom firmware.  They have EXPLICITLY stated that.  

If you disagree with that statement you either don't know what you're talking about or you're a conspiracy theorist that is too insane to have a conversation on reality with.  

Everything works on a spectrum.  WiFi is religated to a particular spectrum.  Now, firmware is, now, typically what regulates what spectrum your wifi operates on.  You modify that and suddenly gram's dies cause his pacemaker cut out, your cousin's hearing aid doesn't work so he cant hear anything, the tv cant function, you neighbors cant make a 911 call to save little timmys life.  That said, you get great wifi reception in your house.  

This whole thing is a response to firmware that expanded the spectrum routers were working on that ACTUALLY caused problems with radar at airports.  

And ya know what? The fcc realized that after they posted this there was going to be some unintended consequence, if taken at the letter of the law instead of the spirit.  

So, write comments.  Its important they dont fuck this one up.  But dont flood them with bullshit.  This title is misleading and will cause spam that will drown reasonable feedback in all the bullshit, which is bad.  

OP, you are bad and you should feel bad.

Most of the time, these are intentional news item planted by intelligence community or some interested party but rarely true. Even when they are true, timing is usually to match some other objective like for diverting attention from another heinous thing happening at the same time. 

Most of the journalists are paid agents; whether by choice is a moot point. Reporting is a job for them and they should be treated as such. Whatever helps them go ahead in their career, they do it and 'interested parties' take full advantage of it.

Looking back at [footage of the actual raid on Kim Dotcoms house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMas0tWc0sg) it's insane overkill. A helicopter, tactical units, hundreds of officers, dogs, guns everywhere. 

The raid was [ruled illegal in New Zealand court](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/mega-victory-kim-dotcom-search-warrants-invalid-mansion-raid-illegal/), then after [two years of legal battle under appeal ruled legal but confiscation of Kim's assets during the raid illegal](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/warrant-for-raid-on-kim-dotcom-legal-new-zealand-supreme-court-rules/). At this point much of MegaUploads equipment had been taken by the FBI back to the US. Kim has been forced to fight through courts each step of the way to get bank accounts unfrozen, equipment illegally taken returned, etc. 

[MPAA piles on additional concurrent lawsuits for Kim to deal with.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/mega-pile-on-mpaa-sues-kim-dotcom-whos-already-facing-criminal-charges/)  The strategy pretty clearly looks like even if these things done were illegal, simply overwhelm Kim and his resources beyond their capability to mount an effective defense until something gives. 

That's pretty fucked.

But yeah. That's now how the law works.

And honestly, I'm pretty sure Dotcom was in hardcore cover-yer-ass mode when he started Mega. That was already attempt #2 at this game, and I suspect he was meticulous about safe harbor process.

It's extremely sad to me that American law enforcement, particularly federal law enforcement, has taken up the strategy of pushing the limits of their restrictions as far as possible (to the point of basically ignoring them altogether, that pesky Constitution always getting in their way), and then only reigning back when some random group of individuals somewhat stumbles upon enough authority to push back.  In this manner, they've continually and without pause grown in scope and authority by essentially making things *de facto* legal.  What I mean by this is, to them the only things that are illegal to do are the things that the victims are able to drum up enough support to stop (and by working through a system that they control).

I watched Carmen Ortiz speak about the DoJ's ["Smart on Crime"](http://www.justice.gov/ag/attorney-generals-smart-crime-initiative) initiative while in [law school](https://www.bc.edu/schools/law/newsevents/2014/ortiz_lalsa.html) a couple of years ago. The entire presentation was on just outcomes for first time, non-violent offenders and proper allocation of DoJ's limited resources. I couldn't help but notice the extreme disparity between the initiative and her actions on the Aaron Swartz case. 

During the Q&A, one of the professors asked about the Aaron Swartz case. I can't recall the question exactly, but I think she asked if putting Aarzon Swartz into a position where he would have to plead guilty or risk being sentenced to enormous jail time was just punishment for a first time, non-violent offender. Carmen Ortiz said the entire thing was misconstrued, that she did not intend for Swartz to serve a long prison sentence, and that his suicide was unfortunate. There was more to it, but it was so long ago I can no longer remember. 

These kinds of speeches are typically recorded by the law school and available to students for later viewing and I couldn't wait to post the video on Reddit as soon as it was available. I learned the next day that after the end of the event Ortiz asked the faculty organizing the event to delete the video. I'm not sure if that is a common request, but it was granted. Really unfortunate, makes me feel like she has higher political aspirations.

Today marks the three year anniversary since we lost Internet activist, RSS, Markdown and Creative Commons developer, and Reddit co-founder [Aaron Swartz]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) (Nov 8 '86 – Jan 11 '13). It's been three years of inaction on the passing of the Aaron’s Law Act to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act under which he was charged. The bill was proposed to reform the Act that was passed in 1986 when the country was spooked after the movie War Games saw a schoolkid hacker inadvertently almost initiate global thermonuclear war. It wasn’t possible, but the Act was drawn up swiftly and passed, and the country felt safe again. Today, when techology has moved exponentially beyond that of 1986, that Act is still one of the prime tools used to prosecute any online acts of tech dissonance. 


Upon Aaron’s passing, the Aaron’s Law Act was put to Senate by sponsors Sen. Ron Wyden [D-OR] and Rep. Zoe Lofgren [D - CA 19]), but [it was not enacted.]( https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2454)


Here’s his bio-documentary telling the tale: [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ) [1:44:59] [IMDB]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/)


[Aaron’s Law Act]( https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1918) was reintroduced last year, to little attention. 


Aaron helped ignite the [Internet Blackout]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA) of 2012 that united the Internet in getting the SOPA/PIPA Acts blocked. On this sad anniversary, let us remember, and start a fire in memory of Aaron.

My unpopular opinion: If you know something is illegal and choose to break the law anyway then you can expect to be thrown in jail. If you choose to practice civil disobedience and spend the time to make a statement, you better be a lot tougher than Swartz was. He just wanted to break the law and expected the law to confirm to him. I think he was an egomaniac who couldn't live with the fact that he wasn't quite as important or clever as he thought he was.
269
5916 :: Today marks the three year anniversary since we lost Internet activis...
I'm only a few days older than he was, and I was going through the worst depression of my life during the time he died. Big difference between us is that I fucked up my past, but he fucked up his future. 

Also he was intelligent and people liked him and he was a good person and a hard worker.

5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
So I have AT&T and I have easytether pro, which allows me to tether despite having the tether feature locked/disabled because of my unlimited plan. Will they be able to tell if I am tethering? How can they tell?
822
5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
I have AT&T unlimited plan and EVERY TIME I talk to AT&T they try to screw me out of it. 

I use anywhere between 6 and 12 GB of data a month. I use enough data where the price I'm paying for unlimited is cheaper than buying a 6-12 GB plan...

I go in there to upgrade a phone... the person helping me says, "Oh... I accidentally removed your unlimited data... and I can't add it back in."

I told them... you will add it back in, because you screwed up. They insisted they couldn't. I called AT&T support in front of them and had them add it back on. No issues.

Go in to split my bill... A few days later I get a text saying I'm close to reaching my GB limit... Uhh, what limit? I check online... of course, I only have 2GB plan. The person helping me removed my plan again... I had to call support to get them to add it back.

I go in to upgrade my phone again, and this is something that has happened the 2 previous times. When they see I have an unlimited plan they do the whole, "Well... if you look at your data usage, you are only using about 2 GB a month... we can enroll you into a 2GB plan or for double the price we can put you into a 4GB plan..."

Nah, it's okay, I don't want you to try to save me money, but thank you...

I didn't think anything of it. I logged into my account that night and it shows me my average usage... It said my average was around 6GB a month... Not only do I use more than the 2 or 4 GB they wanted to give me... the person at the store lied to me, telling me that I only use 2 GB a month and that I would be completely fine saving a little bit of money off my plan by downgrading the data.

tl;dr every time I deal with AT&T they try to trick me off of my dataplan and have even lied to me about my data usage to make it seem like I am spending more money on my data plan than if I would just downgrade to a limited plan. Bunch of lying assholes.

I know it's unlikely to happen, but if Google or Apple decide to become carriers, and give truly unlimited plans for cheap, all the other big carriers will either have to revert or die. Hell, Google could offer an unlimited plan for ***more*** than what AT&T charges, and they'd probably still win out.

People are tired of this crap; we just have no where else to go.

5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
Not surprising. I'm still on my grandfathered unlimited plan and I've been "given a talking to" several times by AT&T bullying me to switch to a tiered data plan. They've inundated me with texts saying I'm reaching my data "limit" when I barely use 1gb of their data per month, the rest wifi. Every time I've renewed my contract I get the runaround about how I needed to switch data (and voice, I'm on the smallest, 450min plan and I'd get rid of that if I could) plans and I have to bitch about it before they shut up about it. AT&T is the Comcast of mobile.
143
5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
Let's not forget that 'tethering' is complete bullshit, designed to upsell you a service you already have.

Whether you access the internet over your phone or via a laptop connected to said phone, the data packets are exactly the same.

5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
Ugh, they did something similar to me a few years ago. I was on the unlimited plan, and a family member got me a new phone for christmas. I started getting texts that I was close to my data limit on april 3rd. I went in to the store to ask what the deal was, and they told me I had been "upgraded" to limited data. Since 3 months had elapsed, I couldn't "downgrade" back to unlimited. I wonder if it was an accident they didn't tell me I was on limited data until after it was too late for me to fix it?
40
5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
Currently on hold with AT&T trying to get back my unlimited plan that they robbed me of. 
I buy a new iPhone every year (I need new models for development) and EVERY time, they always magically take away my data plan and put me on the 5gb plan. This time when I got the 6s I forgot to call when I received it on the 25th. Today I received a notice that I have used 75% of my 5gb plan. My billing cycle hasn't closed yet, it doesn't close until the 18th. They are refusing to work with me, I used 12-18gb of data a month because and have had the unlimited plan since the original iPhone launch day. i'm about to throw a BF

tl;dr 
AT&T needs some sun because they are shady, and i'm about to throw a bitch fit. 
20
5906 :: AT&T accuses man of tethering without proof, threatens to kill unlimi...
Australian here, why will AT&T not allow tethering? Here, we have pretty meagre data limits, but what we do with that data is (mostly) our business.

5900 :: Google Will Reject All Flash Based Adverts In a Push For HTML5
As someone who spent years making Flash content, I'm fine with this. Coming versions of Adobe's software will be targetting HTML5, anyway, as they're merging it with Adobe Edge (HTML5 Animator) to form Adobe Animate. I think it's better for animated content and games made on Adobe's software to run on the standard web platform, rather than through a buggy, insecure and rescource heavy plugin. HTML5 IS capable of running the content and will only get better as people do more with it. People are already porting old Flash content into HTML5, anyway.

Having said all of that, I will sincerely miss Flash and there is so, so much amazing Flash content on the web which will be completely forgotten, now.

Adverts should not be allowed to contain any active content at all. Static text and a static picture or *maybe* standard-conforming, silent video that's rigorously checked for known malware as well as correct length fields and such should be all that's allowed. No advertiser should be allowed to have access to any turing-complete language on your computer, no matter how well it is isolated from the rest of the system in theory, nor to any markup language that  could allow them to manipulate the rest of the page.

Is there any pressure on these sites/designers that I'm not aware of to switch to HTML 5 or whatever. or will they just be happy to keep on pumping out Flash based things and having us enable them?

5889 :: Time Warner Cable is About to be Sued for Violating Net Neutrality Ru...
I'm reposting this from another thread... but this is a shady company. This is very much a false claim and CNS will lose this.

I do network engineering, I work with some large datacenter networks. We push hundreds of gigabits of traffic. It's extremely rare to get "free peering" unless you're also a network carrier and both parties are mutually benefited by the exchange.

This sounds like a company who wants to get the ISPs to pay for their connectivity. While this may seem like a net neutrality issue, it's really not - net neutrality would have been an issue if TWC degraded speeds to/from their network by using ACLs/throttling to selectively slow down this company.

From my limited knowledge on this specific situation, I don't see how they have an argument. I wish we could get Verizon and Comcast to bring us peering simply because their users connect to us, but it simply does not work that way. I'm responsible for having enough bandwidth to support the requested traffic in the first place.

Take a look at their peering: http://bgp.he.net/AS29697#_peers

They have no direct connections to any big name ISPs, except for maybe Hurricane Electric. Why am I not seeing any Level3, Zayo, NTT, nLayer, Verizon, Cogent, Quest, AT&T, etc? They say they're peering with Google, Microsoft, and others, but all I'm seeing (publicly) is a bunch of second and third tier datacenter and hosting companies. Their traffic destined to /me/ takes a Level3 line the datacenter they rent space from pays for.

Them getting Settlement free peering from Microsoft and Google hardly makes sense. Their business is pushing video streams to "eyeball networks" (residential ISPs usually), so why peer with Google and Microsoft and expect to get much? There aren't that many Google Fiber customers yet... This sounds like they're all members of an Internet Exchange in a Datacenter or city somewhere. That is not direct peering. This is also why you don't see it in the public BGP route tables, since it's really just a quick shortcut to get from one network to the other, not actually an Internet route.

But then the real question is what about TWC? How are they currently involved with CNS? Here's the kicker. They're not. To get to TWC, CNS is hitting their datacenter provider network, then Level3, then TWC.
If there was any legitimate peering dispute, it would have to be between Level3 and TWC. CNS can't just ask for a router port from TWC for free. That's not how this works.

CNS pays for bandwidth from NYInternet, who connects to Level3, who then peers with TWC.

CNS must have a lot of traffic destined to TWC (on their scale, not TWC's scale), so they're trying to save money by making TWC give them a port.

Even if the links between Level3 and TWC were getting saturated or degraded intentionally in some manner, this argument should be between Level3 and TWC.

CNS and/or NYInternet simply need to buy more bandwidth from Level3 or start buying from TWC directly.


TL;DR - ...That's not how any of this works. These guys are doing something fishy. Reddit is blindly support this.

___

EDIT just wanted to post my theory as to what CNS is really doing:

There is a few different things that could be going on, but I'm thinking what CNS is having happen is they send a lot of content to TWC's customers. Since they feel TWC is consuming this content, they want TWC to give them a network port somewhere to directly connect to TWC.

CNS could either get more capacity from NYInternet, get a another connection to directly Level3 or buy another connection from a different provider, or buy a connection directly from TWC.

I do not believe there is any upstream peering points between Level3/TWC that is so congested at CNS is feeling the crunch much. Level3 and TWC push so much traffic that CNS has never been heard of.

CNS really just wants a free connection directly to TWC on TWC's dime. If they want settlement free peering, they need to have TWC pushing equally as much traffic back into CNS, but I know that's not the case. I bet the only real traffic/requests from TWC to CNS are the original content requests.

This is proven by CNS saying TWC's customers are requesting the content for CNS, and that TWC is responsible for that. If this is a problem, CNS should just block TWC customers from their service... Let's see how long they last before regretting that. TWC will not miss them, so there is no way this could be settlement free peering.

5849 :: Spotify: SORRY. We are in the middle of rolling out new terms and con...
As an app developer, one of the biggest strengths I've seen of iOS over Android is that in iOS you have to explicitly ask users for access to each permission you want to use. So if you want to read contacts, the user has to agree in a popup, and it's usually clear _why_ you need access, based on what the user is doing in the app. On Android, developers have to list every permission they could ever use in the app's manifest file and those are granted immediately and permanently on install, so it's a lot less clear to users why you would need a particular permission. It also makes it easy for shady "free flashlight" apps to steal tons of information from people who don't pay attention to the permissions.

Fortunately, that should be changing with Android M, which will allow a confirmation-based permission model.

I really hope Spotify sticks true to their word and doesn't do anything shady with these permissions, and hopefully they'll support Android's new permissions model as soon as it's available.

Note to every IT/Tech company in the world:

Keep your goddamn marketing department at bay. Treat them like a dog and whack them on the nose with a newspaper every now and again.  If you don't, they will do you in in the end.  It happens time and fucking time again. Whether it's through sleazy T&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;Cs, surreptitious data gathering, or leaks/breaches because marketing morons value all that juicy demographic data over security, service and functionality. 

I'm not sure why people have so much disdain for lawyers - marketers make the lawyers necessary through their bullshit shenanigans. 

Edit- ITT: Marketing hacks who think I know nothing about business. Sorry, I've owned a small biz that employs about three dozen folks that hasn't seen a down year since we started 11 years ago. That's because I say that product and service to the customer come first, fucking period. You pull some customer-unfriendly bullshit and you're out.  I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't met marketing folks who have told me about all the money I could make by bending ethics here and there. Nope.  

Embracing a bad market plan is suicide. It's the quickest way to your demise - and the guys who propose it won't care; they'll be out before the consequences set in.  Any change in marketing requires measured analysis and guarded change. You should never surprise your customers, and your customers should never surprise you. This is what I mean by keeping marketing "at bay".  But companies don't get that today. Comcast, EA, Lenovo.. Doesn't matter.   

Everyone replying is acting like this Spotify situation is some kind of exception. Really? As we sit here on Reddit, a site that owes its very existence to a company deciding to fuck over their base for some esoteric market realignment?  And tell me what is killing Lenovo right now.  Tell me what keeps Android fragmented. It ain't the tech. Please, spare me. 

A good read on the topic is "From Good to Great to Gone", by Alan Wurtzel - son of the founder and the former CEO of Circuit City. An excellent story of how to run a good company into the ground by letting your marketers run unchained and live in their own "brand is king" echo chamber.

Wasn't there a high profile journalist that was investigating a senior level exec at a private company or the military that ended up plowing his mercedes into a tree on a normal suburban road? It was ruled an accident, but lots of questions surrounding it, especially the lack of brakes being applied before ramming straight into a wall / tree.

5846 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - "While it'...
To clarify,  he is posting content from behind a pay wall,  not his own annotations. His argument is that it's an abuse of copyright to put that particular content behind a pay wall.  The state's argument is that it costs money to have annotated versions available, and that instead of using tax dollars they put it behind a pay wall so that only the people that want to use it pay for it (like toll roads).  To me, that seems to be a specious argument assuming the annotations already exist and simply need to be uploaded,  but I am not a lawyer or a legislator.

5846 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - "While it'...
Georgia lawyer here.  

Just to clarify, the state of Georgia has a deal with Lexis Nexis to host "free public access" to the Georgia Code.  You can see it [here - click on the "Georgia Code" button on the menu on the left side of the page](http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx).

I'm not familiar with this dispute, but it sounds like what this guy is trying to publish is the O.C.G.A. which is an abbreviation for the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated.  This is the text of the law with annotations compiled for the most part by the publisher, not by the state. Each statute is followed by pages and pages of annotations containing the legislative history of each statute (essentially, the individual Public Law citations every time the statute was amended over the years) and then citation of cases - law suits interpreting various aspects of the statute, including a brief summary of each case.

I don't know how much Lexis Nexis works with Georgia's legislative counsel in compiling these annotations - I suspect not at all. This is Lexis Nexis' intellectual property -- the very reason people pay thousands of dollars for their books and on-line resources.

EDIT - after reading the lawsuit a little more carefully, it looks like Georgia has an arrangement with Lexis Nexis where Lexis Nexis creates the OCGA and has exclusive publishing rights, but the state owns the copyright.  That's why the state is the Plaintiff.  I'm guessing there's some sort of contractual obligation for the state to enforce the copyright.
569
5846 :: Georgia sues man for posting annotated state laws online - "While it'...
The linked article, and the articles engadget links to, are pretty terrible. A key point is that the laws of Georgia ARE posted freely, can be downloaded and posted by anyone, etc. There can be no copyright in the laws of Georgia.

BUT–what is in question here is the annotated version. The annotated version is not a secret set of laws, but rather, it's commentary, it's citations to caselaw, it's the equivalent of a student putting notes in the margin to make things easier to reference.

Reading Georgia's complaint, I'm still uncertain if Georgia paid Lexis-Nexis to create this content as a work for hire, or if the deal is that Lexis-Nexis creates the annotated version and then recoups their costs and makes profit off the subscription fees. (GA said "[t]he copyrighted annotations include analysis and guidance that are added to the O.C.G.A. by a third party publisher of the O.C.G.A. as a work for hire" but also said that without the paywall, they'd have to do away with the annotations or use tax dollars to pay for the development.)

Either way, several key takeaways. First, again, the law of Georgia is being posted freely. It's the annotated version that is behind a paywall. Second, it is not at all clear that taxpayer money was used to develop the annotated version, even if the State of Georgia claims the copyright. Third, there is no general right to an annotated version of the law. Four, you don't NEED an annotated version of the law. It can be nice to have, but the things it links to (case law, opinions of the Georgia Attorney General, and legislative history), can all be found, for free, elsewhere. You have to do more work, but the annotations are Cliff Notes to things that are freely available. 

Lastly, some people seem to think that the annotations are things that are used "to establish case law", are "referred to by...[a] section of government", or are "being used to guide the decisions of the judges in actual legal cases". This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the value of the annotated code is. With possible rare exceptions for legislative intent, the annotated code isn't what decisions are being based on nor will the language of the annotated code be in a decision. Generally, the annotations are merely an index to the primary sources that will be used, cited, and otherwise referred to. Lawyers, judges, etc. aren't going to say that the annotated code points to cases X, Y, and Z, lawyers and judges are going to point to cases X, Y, and Z. If there was no annotated code, they would STILL point to cases X, Y, and Z, and they'd probably still use Lexis (or Westlaw, or Fastcase, or Loislaw, or another private paywalled legal database company) to find the information.

EDIT: I'll concede that this arrangement is definitely strange, in that even after reading the complaint and the articles, I'm not sure why the State of Georgia has the copyright to the annotated version and not Lexis. But it's NOT strange for there to paywalled, private legal resources that are commonly used in a jurisdiction. There are several large legal database companies that take publicly available information, add their own annotations, headnotes, etc., and put them in expensive, proprietary databases. It is legal to republish Supreme Court decisions. It is not legal to republish Westlaw's or Lexis-Nexis's version of Supreme Court decisions with all the headnotes, annotations, KeyCites, and other tools that they added on to it.

It's obvious from the comments here that most people don't understand what "annotated" means. The text of all laws is freely available on multiple sites, such as [findlaw.com](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/georgia-law.html) and the Georgia state legislature website.  The suit is about the original commentary created by Matthew Bender (part of Lexis), as the [complaint explains](https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/07/24/georgia-suit-public-resource.pdf):

When I had cable for a short time, I hated the box - slow performance, just terrible UI. When I cancelled, they asked why, and I said it was the horrible box experience. Then they said "oh, that's an old box, we have a better one in service too". 

Well, too late, good for you, and screw you for caring so little to allow such a variance in experience due to dumb luck.

It amazes me how many people have forgotten, or never knew, that cable tuners _used_ to be built into damn near every TV & VCR made.

Wayyyy back in the 90s we had this problem solved and then the cable companies lobbied Congress and BOOM, suddenly every channel is not only digital it's also encrypted.

Meanwhile digital tuners are _still_ being stuck into Televisions but they are useless on a cable system because every channel is now needlessly encrypted. 

We have quite literally gone _backwards_ on this since the early 90s. What a shame...and a sham.

The same for cable modems, you pay a monthly rental fee.  But the thing is, they don't offer to upgrade your modem even though it'll literally cost them nothing (OK, it would technically, but by the time you need a new modem they've already made way more from you than the modem cost them).  I called up to get faster internet and they said my current modem wouldn't work with it.  The guy on the phone was honestly surprised I was still using such an old modem, apparently my current connection would be faster with a new modem.  So Time Warner has been renting me a modem they _knew_ couldn't even fully use the service I was paying (too much) for.

The same with the cable box when I had that, when I returned it the person at the counter was like "wow, that's an old one."  Am I supposed to call them and beg for a new one or something?  Apparently there were services I couldn't access on that one, so again, Time Warner renting me devices I can't even use to fully access the services I paid (too much) for.

Who doesn't like paying extra for a box that is required to get the service you already pay for? The best part are the ads on the guide and having to use the same interface as when you were in grade school, thankfully it's still just as slow. I can't wait for the end of each OnDemand show I watch because then I get to navigate the whole menu again, even a whole extra menu deep for HD, just to get to the next episode. /s

I can't ever see myself ever going back to cable. The big Cable industry companies have ruined it for me. Their crappy fees, over priced rented hardware, poor customer service, retarded techs and stupid taxes are all more than I can handle for the price I was paying. The value just isn't there and hasn't been for along time. The entire cable industry is just unfriendly to consumers in nearly all aspects. I am now a happy customer with Amazon, Hulu, Netflix and a set of rabbit ears. There are a few live cable channels I would like to have but it's not worth the hassle of dealing with the cable companies. I also have little doubt that soon there will be many streaming companies that will offer any channel I want at a better price to the hardware I own (Fire TV, Chromecast, PS3).

I wish I could say I dropped Comcast cable because of Net Neutrality or because their service was awful, but I dropped them because of their cable box.

When I had cable I rented a DVR from them. Between it being a cable box, being a DVR, and being HD, I was paying $18 a month. I figured if I could buy it outright for $200, that'd still pay for itself in a year. The processor inside was slow enough that I figured it couldn't cost much. But they wouldn't sell me one.

I asked them if I could buy it, they said no, it's against their policy. I asked to talk to whoever made the policy, that wasn't in the cards.

I asked if there was one on the market I could buy to connect to their service. Sorry, only our boxes work.

I asked, "If I lose my cable box, do I have to pay for it's cost?" 

"Why yes sir, if you lose it, you'll owe us 250"

"Then if I 'find' it again, I'll be it's owner, and it came from you so it'll work on your service, can I use it then?"

"No, lost, broken or stolen boxes are deactivated and can't be used on our network again."

Okay thanks. I called back the next day and cancelled my service. Told the phone rep it was because of their stance on Net Neutrality. At least cancelling was quick and painless. Happy about that.

5837 :: Engineer Who Blamed Himself For Not Stopping Challenger Launch Dies
When I was in engineering school, this man made arrangements to visit various universities and warn young engineers about the dangers of not speaking up in the face of danger. 

We would study the case, what went wrong, channels of communication that ultimately led to ignorance of the problem, and at the end he would come visit for a Q&A and to share his message personally. 

When I studied the case, he wasn't healthy enough to travel, but still went through the trouble to call in for a Q&A, thoughtfully answer questions, and and share his message and his burden. 

As a practicing engineer, I still remember this lesson regularly. Whenever I hesitate with the safety of anything I work on, I remember this man's pain. I know there are many engineers he had the same affect on. 

The message and warning he gave to thousands of engineers will long outlast his guilt. Over time, his message will potentially save thousands from negligence. Rest in peace, your burden has been lifted.

OK, so no. He was not responsible. None of the engineers were. The blame should sit with Orrin Hatch, the senator for Utah. Everyone talks about the O-rings and no one asks why they had them. The answer is politics.

The O-rings exist to keep the gases from coming out the seam between the two pieces of the body. So our next question should be why have two pieces? Why not build it as one? They could have, but then it would be too large to take on trains. They had two options. One company was going to build the lifter body "across the street" from the Cape. Orrin Hatch wanted a Utah company Morton Thiokol to get the contract. So he basically held up funding until they got it. If Hatch had not done that the other company would have built a one piece rocket and there would be no O-Rings to freeze.

5839 :: Obama Administration Unveils $4B Plan to Jump-Start Self-Driving Cars
Okay, my civil libertarian side is showing... I think it's incredibly important that self driving cars report no non-anonymized data back home, for multiple reasons.

First of all, there's no need to know the exact location of specific cars.

1) Any self driving car will need to be able to operate safely even if they hit a network dead zone. This means network access can not be a prerequisite for safe operation.

2) Traffic avoidance can be done by measuring overall traffic in the area with anonymized/averaged data. 

3) A fully self driving car won't require the driver to be licensed. There is no reason to need to know the occupants of the vehicle. If they can only input addresses, there's no potential for negligence or impairment.

If the data for the location for individual cars is available, anywhere, it will be used to spy on us. Since that data cannot be a prerequisite for safe operation, it should not be an intrinsic part of navigation to begin with.

Also, I don't think I've heard anyone talk about this yet, but with thousands of 3d scanners constantly roaming every street, it could have unbelievable effects on our ideas about surveillance and privacy. If someone had access to all that data, even for "safety" purposes, they could have an up to the minute 3d scan of almost every roadside property in the city at a moment's notice. Not only that but they could extrapolate the owners and travels of any arbitrary car by simply watching it from other cars sensors from the beginning to the end of the trip.

Any safe self driving car must be able to operate with no network anyway, we really should make sure nobody ever successfully demands that data, ever, for any reason.

I feel that's equivalent to "I understand they locked their doors prior to these attacks?" With the implicit, "Shouldn't we make locked doors illegal? Or, at least give governments keys to unlock any door?"

With all the efforts our governments are making to intrude on **everyone's** privacy, what makes you think they are even using electronic devices?  At this point they have probably gone old school with dead drops, coded messages in the classifieds, etc.

Just another excuse to intrude on our lives.  Hell, they were even told about these terrorists directly, and did nothing about them.  How is infringing on our privacy going to correct that?

>“’The most difficult communication between these terrorists is via PlayStation 4,’ the minister said, three days before the terrorist attacks in Paris. ‘It’s very, very difficult for our services — not only Belgian services but international services — to decrypt the communication that is done via PlayStation 4.'”

What? Why would it be more difficult to decrypt playstation communication than encrypted information sent over a regular pc?

edit:
okay the next paragraph tries to explain it away with difficulties monitoring in game voice chat and strange communication methods that are difficult to spy on, like shooting walls. But you can still do those things on pc just the same? I dont understand the point at all.

Bad people are going to communicate and plot bad things.  It should not be our government's business to try an control or listen into every communication they have.  If we accept that we should, the next logical step would be controlling their thoughts in an Orwellian type of society.  

I think it would be more productive to consider what causes terrorists to feel the way they do.  If people in a country believe big businesses, oil companies, have co-opted their government leaving them in poverty and under martial law, then maybe we should focus on what it is our businesses are doing abroad and *their* corporate thoughts and policies.  It's as if we let profiteers run amok abroad, and then we have to deal with the consequences when the people adversely affected decide to seek revenge through terrorism.

Budgets. Budgets are where large organizations choose what to do. Security people? The budget for those guys is over on the secret 'spy on you' side of the government, not the basic functions in public side.

One of the problems for IT peeps in gov is privilege. Nothing shuts down basic security procedures faster than bosses who won't change anything in their own work habits. "I need Edna in Accounting to see my spreadsheet. Why doesn't that work?" It's truly weird symptom of privilege that management dictates to IT.

For those that don't know what an SF-86 is for. It is the document filled out by potential personnel that need a Security Clearance. You know those people that say "i have top secret clearance." 

Along with your name, Social Security number and DOB.  An SF-86 has a detailed list of questions ranging from all past ~~drug use~~, ~~sexual encounters~~(these are logged during the Top Secret clearance interview) , Family member names and addresses, education, employment, criminal record....pretty much everything you've ever done in your life and anyone you've ever had a close relationship with is in the document.

In the wrong hands, an SF-86 can not just ruin your life, it can be used to ruin the lives of those around you. A million of these documents in the hands of another country seems like a nightmare. 

Edit

___________________________________

Your full social security number, full name, DOB and passport information is plenty enough to ruin your life with identity left, loans taken in your name, property bought and sold in your name, credit cards etc.

The other stuff is mostly for blackmail purposes, or depending on where you worked even corporate espionage. If a foreign country knows you worked for some nuclear research company, and they happen to also know all your personal info including your parents and siblings names, addresses etc they may wish to threaten you for answers.

That last bit isn't out of the realm of possibility considering we're talking about at least some people with access to information that deals with nation security.

It's odd how it takes one individual to open the gate to what many knew and were expecting/assuming way before his leaks.  

It just takes a basic understanding of how the internet and computer networks operates to understand it's weaknesses that comes from the old design. 

We are way overdue to rebuild a more secure/private internet, but that means to almost rewrite and rethink the whole tcp/ip network stacks which is no easy feats, ipv6 is barely taking off.
6
5810 :: Steve Wozniak: Edward Snowden is 'a hero to me' | Apple co-founder sa...
I've always liked the "Woz", he was a engineer and always for the users, for privacy, decency and making people happy with his creations.

The Apple Computer of old was a much different animal than the large manipulative company it is today.

Back in those days computing was fun, it had so much potential because hardware was open as well as software, let the world create things for the computer was the staple of the day.

Now of course it's all CRAPSTORE and closed hardware/software, where some blowhard Ive's think he knows what is best for you and that your stupid and can't decide for yourself. Try to change the UI on a OS X Mac, good luck as it won't last because Apple releases a new OS X version annually to break it.

Steve Jobs was a greedy, abusive, control freak S.O.B. who stole great ideas and manipulated others, including his own customers, locking them into a Stockholm Syndrome Effect and milking them for their money. Not really giving people what they wanted or needed, but whatever he felt. It was Steve Jobs way or the highway. [It's why Mac's have a pitiful 5% market share now (see Net Applications) down from 11%.](http://regmedia.co.uk/2014/03/14/statcounter_small.jpg)

This sums up Steve Jobs...

["Tie all of our products together, so we further lock customers into our ecosystem," - Steve Jobs.](http://www.cnet.com/news/steve-jobs-wanted-to-further-lock-customers-into-apples-ecosystem/)

The world would have been a much better place for computing if the "Woz" was allowed to balance out Job evil streak. Of course Jobs is in the NSA's control freak pocket, even hiring a NSA guy David Rice to head Apple Product Security. [The iPhone is nothing but a electronic dog collar for people and they didn't even have the common courtesy of telling anyone about it.](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-secret-location-tracking-2011-4)

775
5810 :: Judge confirms what many suspected: Feds hired Carnegie Mellon Univer...
None of this would come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the SEI- it's a federally funded research facility operated by CMU, not a department or school within the University. JPL is run by Caltech for NASA- this is the same type of relationship.

Is it concerning that any research facility works with NSA et al to break Tor? Absolutely. 

Is the government using university researchers to undermine privacy, and is CMU complicit in this? Only if you're not paying attention.

Per wiki

> The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The SEI also has offices in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, California. The SEI operates with major funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. The SEI also works closely with industry and academia through research collaborations.

>"Tor users clearly lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in their IP addresses while using the Tor network."

Yes, when one uses some of the most secure technology on Earth to protect their privacy, they're clearly lacking a reasonable expectation of privacy.

edit: for those responding about the literal most secure tech for privacy and the specific facets of privacy that Tor does and does not protect, you're really missing the point. I agree that Tor isn't the most secure thing on the planet. My point has more to do with the fact that it's laughable to think that a user of Tor doesn't expect any reasonable amount of privacy.
346
5810 :: Judge confirms what many suspected: Feds hired Carnegie Mellon Univer...
And this is why you use a VPN to access TOR. 
92
5810 :: Judge confirms what many suspected: Feds hired Carnegie Mellon Univer...
No, the judge doesn't actually confirm this. We are still just left with suspicion.

The judge confirms that CMU found his IP address while "conducting research" on the Tor network. This feeds into what many already suspected, but the judge does not explicitly state the purpose of the research grant. So we are left without a confirmation that "Feds hired CMU to break Tor" even though we highly suspect it.
14
5810 :: Judge confirms what many suspected: Feds hired Carnegie Mellon Univer...
so, what is an alternative to tor? Or should I not worry about it? 
22
5810 :: Judge confirms what many suspected: Feds hired Carnegie Mellon Univer...
Judge Jones over reaches on the idea of a "real expectation of privacy."

 > ...Tor users clearly lack a reasonable expectation of privacy ...while using the Tor network. In other words, they are taking a significant gamble on any real expectation of privacy under these circumstances.

"In other words", the government will intrude upon you if at all possible.

Judge Jones needs better technical advice.

I don't personally see any difference between an ip address and my telephone number/connection.  In both cases they are mechanical necessities for the service to work, yet courts have ruled that telephone users continue to have reasonable expectations of privacy.

> James Murdoch, who heads 21st Century Fox, said politely that his thinking on the subject was “evolving” — and not in Netflix’s favor.

Last week the new season of American Horror Story started, between the last one and this one I cut my cable subscription so we only have Netflix at home. When the season was about to start I was asked by the teenagers in the house how to watch the show (the show is in FX Network, its parent company... Fox Entertainment Group). Anyway, I went to their website and there was an option to stream the channel live, I also have an icon in the AppleTV that should let me stream the channel. However, when you try to use any of these options you are asked to confirm your cable subscription, bummer. I will have no problem if I have to pay $5 a month or $2 per episode, the technology seems to be there already to be able to provide such model, I want to pay them for their content. I just refuse to pay the astronomical prices for cable for just 12-15 hours per year. So, what happens in the end? I just torrent the episode the following day. At the end they are hurting themselves by not providing alternative options to access their content.

I find it annoying that cable companies are mad they are going to lose customers due to internet. YOU PROVIDE OUR INTERNET SERVICE. Which is relatively new income. You basically are switching from making your money from cable to internet. Some people have both. You were also able to double your profits for 15-20 years due to people having both. Times change, adapt or die.

Look at that.  Netflix took over an entire industry by offering people what the want at one tenth of the cost.

At this point, if they formed their own cable company and offered service without creeping rates up every year like Rogers Cable did, I'd use Netflix as my provider.

EDIT: Wow, I had absolutely no idea that this comment was going to get so much feedback! It's nice to see that there is an interest in this project. I would love to give more of a detailed explanation, but we are in the very preliminary stages of the vegetation microbiome study at this point. NASA has primarily been focused on the human microbiome in space (here a synopsis of the study aims if you're interested: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1010.html). Hopefully I'll get a chance to answer more fully later!

I think they have started to use location data to make friends suggestions.

It's creepy, I was contracting at a university miles away from my home town and I kept getting suggestions to add local people and to add the customers I was working for.

Let me tell you my experience of how much data mining Facebook does. I closed my account about 4-5 yrs ago. My friends and I have a podcast so I created a Facebook page. The only personally accurate information I entered was my date of birth and city. I added three people who are part of the podcast and that's it. Then, it started making friend suggestions. Pretty much everyone it suggested were the people that I knew. People that only I would know out of the three people I added. Basically the algorithm could figure out who I was from those 3 pieces of information.

The part I don't like is when it scrapes email contact lists. While my friend and I were traveling, he used my phone to login to his email. Now every person from his email contact list is showing up in my People You May Know. I had to log into my work email from my phone at a later time and now I'm getting every single person that has made an inquiry to my buisness. 

I accepted the Terms and Services that it would scan my phone Contacts, but what options do I have to pick which emails accounts it can scan? How can I make them off limits?

And what about my friend? He logged into his Gmail, and logged out in Gmail, but every app on my phone scanned everything while he was logged in. When was he offered the Terms and Services? Does Facebook and all other apps expect me to pull up every TS of every app to show my friend before he can use my device?

5 Star reviews:

Stacy- Good!

Paul- Perfect!

Brad- ;) :)

Eric- Amazing, love it

Karen- Love it love it

Jeff- Perfect! :)

Then you go to the one star reviews:

Nick- I paid full price for this app and at first I loved it but then it just stopped working.  I emailed the developers and they didn't help me at all or even offer to refund me the $2.99 I paid for the app.  Please avoid this scam.

As a consumer the right to leave truthful reviews is important, but it is a complicated issue. I manage the web presence for several of my clients and had an issue recently where a new restaurant had a series of negative reviews on Yelp. I was going through them and it turns out that one of the more recent ones was a former employee who was legitimately fired. The interesting thing was that he gave a one star review and a questionably accurate story, but a few months prior he had also left a five star review while he was still employed there. I did some more digging and it turned out that two of the other one star reviews were from people that were on his Facebook friends list. Businesses should not be able to remove truthful reviews but there should be some channel of recourse or standard for handling maliciously manufactured campaigns against a business.

Comcast should be broken up forcefully. I do **NOT** normally support this kind of intervention, but under extreme circumstances it is appropriate. Comcast uses its size to price gouge consumers.

491
5753 :: Windows 10 will no longer let you Google search from Cortana
I think it's pretty clear that there are large advantages for AI search assistants like Siri, Google Now, and Cortana to pipe the queries through their own search engines. The different parts of the engine can be integrated together to produce results that can go above simply feeding back the results of a web search.

With the recent Build conference heavily centered around AI, I'd expect Cortana (which is actually a very capable product when compared to competitors) to get stepped up a few notches and really start to do more powerful stuff with the query results. A lot of this is going to be dependent on information processed on cloud computing (like Wolfram Alpha's results) and will depend on queries being sent to Microsoft's own datacenters.

I guess I'm not as against this as most seem to be. Services like Cortana and Siri will increasingly diverge from old school web search results. That said, I don't see why typing "Google X" into Cortana shouldn't do a Google query. It's a feature meany people will use, but I can definitely see why MS doesn't want external engines set as default as the product evolves. And yes, of course there is a "walled garden" appeal as well for MS, but I honestly do think there's more to it than that.

5746 :: New leak claims T-Mobile will announce unlimited high-speed streaming...
So lets just say fuck Net Neutrality then? Because I expect this to be welcomed with open arms like the music streaming despite the preferential treatment of data based on its source. I know the FCC is seemingly OK with this crap at the moment but this sets a really bad precedent that Verizon and AT&T are going to abuse.

For example, I have a Plex server. That traffic comes from my house. I guarantee you that isn't going to be added to this program. You won't be able to get things added to it unless you are a big player, meaning there will be no room for new players.

If T-Mobile is fine with making Netflix streaming unlimited they need to just knock it the fuck off with data caps all together then because it is clear at this point that they don't exist to mitigate congestion. They already do offer some unlimited plans. Go the full mile.

3. Have reddit fall in line again while still having all the original unpopular decisions in place (possibly removing some just for good measure)

4. Profit


Call me a cynic, but this doesn't rub me right. Oh well, as long as the anti-Pao circlejerk stops, I'm okay with it. Just thought I'd put it out there.

We did NOT win shit here:

When a company decides to make sudden and unpopular changes it hires an "interim" CEO to do the dirty work. They take all the heat and stick around just long enough to implement new policy and fire people.

Then the "interim" CEO leaves suddenly, with a bag of cash and disappears. The community feels victorious. Yay! We win! They will now be more likely to accept the new management that are all still ass-hats, but less so than the "interim" CEO they dubbed Hitler. And after some kind of outreach bologna the storm settles and tomorrow is a new day.

Mission accomplished.

5737 :: With Fixed Costs And Fat Margins, Comcast's Broadband Cap Justificati...
Bought a house in an area that has Fios or Comcast. My old home had only Comcast as an option, so I had an open account with them.  
Pricewise, Comcast was a couple bucks cheaper for the same service.  
I still switched over to Fios.  
It felt so fucking good to call and cancel my account. When they asked why i'm cancelling, i gave a very brief explanation of the fact that I am 100% against the datacaps they are pushing on customers, even if it hasn't reached my area yet.  
The customer service guy pretended to have no idea what i was talking about. But he knew...he knew...

I feel that, unlike Blockbuster video who had no idea that they were headed for a financial cliff of epic proportion, Comcast is well aware of that fact. Because of that, they're doing whatever they can on their voyage into oblivion to milk every last cent of profit.

When they finally do die a horrible cataclysmic doom, I'm absolutely certain they'll lay the blame for their demise on "unfair" this and that of other companies, states and the federal government as a whole, while not seeing any irony in that what so ever.

5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'
I had an experience as a "reviewer" with a company Eteckcity. I got to choose from a list of products form a webpage which they would send to me and within a week I had to post a review. It was all good, the products were definitely another Chinese re branded product, but they did what they were advertised to do, so I gave them 5 stars. Except one time I gave one of their products a 4 star review (it was a jewlers scale). That single time I received an email asking why I didn't give it 5 stars. I provided a detailed explanation, and from then on any time I requested a product they were "out" of that one or the webpage was suddenly out of date and those products weren't open for review anymore. I was effectively "removed" from the program for a 4 star review, but they couldnt say that to me otherwise they would be caught admitting they were skewing reviews. Fucking eteckcity.

5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'
I have bought some items from Amazon which were fakely reviewed. I ended up sending them back which cost me time and cost Amazon shipping. The reviewers were quite clever in their language and wording. It has since made me very guarded against certain types of suspiciously positive 5 star reviews.

What I have learned to do now is to cross-examine the product on other sites like Ebay and the manufacturer's site, to make sure I know where it's made, and what the baseline cost of the item is.

I'm glad they're standing up for honesty, the internet is a goddamn smelter of lies. I'm so sick of Twitter bots and fake companies, fake reviewers and reviewer sweatshops that sell opinion. I hope these people fucking pay.

5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'
I do a bit of graphic design on the side and recently got contacted by a fairly large UK art supply manufacturer offering me some free gear if I gave the products some good Amazon reviews - didn't actually like the products at all and I told the company I wouldn't feel right saying the item was good when it really wasn't but they informed me I would be breaking my end of the deal if I posted a negative review and they'd 'take action' against me.

And now I guess if you post fake reviews Amazon can take action against you too. Moral of the story is don't get fooled by lame-ass companies basically buying good reviews but also not to get involved if they offer you free stuff. Nothing is free.  
404

123
5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'
Good that they're taking action, make an example of few to scare off the rest.  
  
But with a technology giant like Amazon I wonder why they're not just using simple data analysis techniques to detect and down-weigh these reviews, just the total amount of money a user spent buying stuff on Amazon should be a strong enough indicator on its own
1016
5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'
The Amazon review system is a joke.  I hate the fact that they merge reviews for different model products.  The reviews should be tied to a distinct model. 

Toggle the different models the reviews stay the same.
For Example: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KTLG9AK
718
5734 :: Amazon sues 1,114 'fake reviewers'

Before current rating systems like Amazon and Yelp, this word of mouth advertising/marketing existed in user forums and even BBS in the 90s and I used to do it. The company I worked for made millions off of corporate advertisers from movie studios, pharmaccueticals,  and technology companies websites that were looking a boost and even damage control. 

We'd basically write entire forum threads with a problems that the client's product could answer. For example, the first post would be a rant about loving coffee, what's a good way to save money, etc. Then a thread with about 6-10 respondants would be designed after it to casually name drop the product with a link. Maybe one of them would support client's product. Then the campaign manager had thousands of legit emails and ip addresses to post all the responses from at different times to make them seem real. Once these were mixed in with organic responses, they were almost undetectable - and extremely effective.

I have always felt terrible about that job. It was good money, but I just couldn't take the guilt once I figured out what was going on. I was young and dumb and broke....but really good at it.

You know, I'm not a mod so I don't know anything about their grievances, and for all we know Victoria could have been stealing laptops from Reddit HQ (doubt it), but I think a lot of us have, at several points, gotten real sick of some bullshit that Reddit has pulled. 

Admins pop in and out and ban posts and subreddits but apparently can't be bothered to tell iAMA when they're going to release someone extremely important to the community and day-to-day operations of that subreddit (and practically the only Reddit employee that anyone still liked), after making arrangements with several important people that can no longer be kept.

They don't appreciate the mods or the community, when any value this site has is entirely crowdsouced by the *mods and the community*. And they just sit on the top as if they own or control any of this. Like, seriously, just stay the fuck out and appreciate what you have, namely, large amounts of money generated every day by the people that resent you. I don't think any situation on Reddit has ever been improved by the involvement of the admins. This problem has been going on long before Pao became CEO, and I don't think the admins and staff can change enough in the wake of the precedents they have set. I don't want her to step down, because I want this site to end so that people finally have an incentive to move on to a new one.

I have an app on my phone called "kid mode" well I downloaded a free ABC-123 add-on with in that app.  

My daughter is 2 so when she snags my phone I put it in kid mode and let her play with it.

I always check the apps before she plays them.  So I check out this ABC-123 app.  I start playing it, and I don't wanna brag but I'm pretty fucking good at numbers and letters but that's beside the point.  I'm not even a minute in from tapping the screen and an add pops up.  This add is colorful and beautiful.  I click on it and it takes me to this screen full of all these downloads and basically says ,"click here to download such and such."  I left and uninstalled that add on app.  Looks like she'll only be coloring from now on. Scumbag apps.

I'll be a lot more impressed when the gmail web interface stops showing S/MIME and GPG signed emails as having a suspicious "smime.p7s" or "signature.asc" attachment.  They don't even have to validate the signature, just handle it in a less obtuse way for users.

Increased attention for encryption on the wire is a great first step, but we need better support for encryption and signing in the gmail user agent as well.

SSL/TLS doesn't encrypt your emails in essence, it merely encrypts your connection to, say, a gmail server. Your emails remain unencrypted on the server's storage devices. unless you use a program like GnuPG. which is for end-to-end encryption. GPG protects your messages always, while SSL/TLS merely prevents using traffic sniffing to get your emails.

>Google’s efforts to keep users safe might be forcing other email providers to make better security decisions. In February, the company started flagging unencrypted emails, allowing Gmail users to know whether they're sending emails to, or receiving emails from, providers that don't support TLS encryption. Since then, the amount of inbound mail sent over an encrypted connection to Gmail users has increased by 25 percent, Google explained in a blog post released today.

Here is a little heads up about TLS -

I've had to learn how to maintain my employer's mail server recently. We were blocked by GMail and had to fix/upgrade various things that my boss *never would have cared about* had GMail continued to accept our mail.

What they've done is used their market power to enact positive change for the world.

Good on them!

Likewise, thanks to Apple and Microsoft for outright rejecting Exchange 2003 servers. The product is LONG depreciated, has known exploits, and companies I work with refuse to upgrade "as long as it works." So Apple and Microsoft break them intentionally so that "as long as it works" no longer applies and companies will actually pay the modest amount it costs to upgrade to a secure system. (Or just !@#$ing install Linux already and get your free rolling updates for eternity.)

For those who don't know: The internet isn't one thing. It's a collection of things. It's an ecosystem. And as the ecosystem evolves, so must the nodes that you use to talk to that ecosystem. Supporting archaic systems is both [impractical financially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), and ill-advised because old, depreciated systems always have unfixed security holes that will compromise the integrity of the entire ecosystem. If someone has an insecure mail server, and you send an e-mail to them, that's it. Your e-mail, your private thoughts and medical records, your company secrets, are now public. It can even be intercepted in the middle (as it hops from one node on the internet to the next) without ever touching the insecure server.

So the only problem with this is that the content itself is not encrypted once the email is at rest and not in transit. The company I currently work for does that aspect, encrypt the content, so only your intended parties get access to the key to access that content. People think that their data is safe just because in transit it is safe, when the problem is often when the data is at rest.

Hello reddit.
[I am](http://areben.com) the creator of **[All Prior Art](http://allpriorart.com/about/)** ( [proof](http://allpriorart.com/reddit) ) I saw a bunch of traffic to the site from here so figured I'd be available to answer questions. ([Please read the "about" page before asking a question](http://allpriorart.com/about/))

Note: Will return later to answer any additional posts

FAQ (I noticed some repeat comments):

*Aren't you taking away people's ability to be innovative and profit from it?*

-The title of this reddit post may have skewed the initial intent, which was:
"The concept is to democratize ideas, provide an impetus for change in the patent system, and to preempt patent trolls." The ideas generated should be highly derivative and not especially innovative or creative.

*There are no dates, therefore not usable as prior art*

-Each unit generated is timestamped with [UNIX epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (which is a date to the second) and archived on [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/AllPriorArt/) with a timestamp

*There is not enough information in the text to be prior art*

-There was some debate among lawyers I spoke with if the text was enough for a person "skilled in the art" to reproduce the ones that make sense. I think many if not most are (courts would have to decide), but just in case I made a sister site with more verbose but less human readable output at [All The Claims](http://alltheclaims.com). Further, I think if this website is ever used in a legal case, a lawyer can make a good argument that if a computer can generate it, it then fails the "obviousness" test for a patent. 

*This is stupid / it won't hold up / the patent office won't use it / etc..*

-While it will be great if this turns out to be a viable tool to fight patent trolls, as long as it is sparking discussion and thinking, it is performing its purpose. If it does turn out to not hold up in court, maybe a similar idea will. This is running off an old server in my studio, imagine if there was a patent troll with the resources of Amazon or Google putting effort towards this idea - coupling much more hardware along with better algorithms and things like deep learning actually publishing algorithmically generated patents. I think this signals a need for a new way of thinking about IP in certain contexts.

*Do you have a good example?*

-A redditor posted [this one](http://allpriorart.com/1461072775-cb753575-3435-47ee-a3c4-109652abcf43/) which seems to describe a bag to urinate in that is also a flashlight

How legal is this? Couldn't somebody actually invent something that all prior art made and then argue that they should have the patent because all prior art is just a monkey with a typewriter, and did not truly come up with the idea?

This reminds me of a book called Accelerando which starts out with a guy doing basically this. He thinks up great ideas, patents them as open source, and only expects returns in the form of reputation. 

In the circles he walks in, however, rep is more important than money, kind of like.... waitaminute which website is that similar to? I know it's familiar.

5697 :: A project called All Prior Art generates millions of trivial ideas an...
As an attorney who specialized in patents and is now working as a patent examiner, I see many, many problems with this.

First and foremost - there are no dates. Prior art is useless without dates. 

Second, giving a vague idea is not really prior art. There is no enablement, a broad description doesn't really teach the invention or how to specifically make it in sufficient detail to be of any use to anyone. It is unlikely these would be sufficient to reject or prevent most patents unless the idea is very, very simple.

Third, if it is randomly generated, some of these may already be patented. 

There are other issues, but you get the idea.

This is an interesting idea.  Unfortunately, you fundamentally misunderstand how patents work.  

You can't patent an *idea*. You can only patent an invention, process, etc.

Your program is generating a bunch of random ideas, not a bunch of inventions.  The fact that someone has had an *idea* before doesn't mean that no one can patent an invention that implements the idea.  

You can't just say things like "fusion drive", "cancer cure", "immortality drug", "teleporter"...and magically render any patent on those things invalid.  There needs to be a prior invention, process, or procedure to do any of these things.  Not just the idea.

Edison, famously, didn't get a patent on the light bulb - some light bulbs already existed and were patented. He got a patent on a particular type of filament (which caused the bulb to work much better).

I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion as the average person doesn't understand IP and its implications, but the APA project is terrible for humanity.

There are so many ideas that just aren't viable to develop without patent protection, I mean, why should I be the one to spend $3m developing and fine tuning a new product that can now be legally copied by someone else for $100k of tooling costs? This applies to all categories including healthcare.

Filing a patent application is you saying to the world: "Look at this thing I came up with which will advance humanity - you can have it for absolutely free after my 20 years. Under the APA that.... just doesn't happen. Its another potentially useful idea thrown away because its no longer viable to develop.

5697 :: A project called All Prior Art generates millions of trivial ideas an...
What a misguided idea.  Superficially, it is making "ideas" available to anyone, but in reality it makes them inaccessible to the kinds of people who would otherwise spend the effort and money to create them.  

If it ever worked the way it is intended, which is unlikely for many reasons, it would be preventing innovation, not protecting it.

5695 :: Portland installs turbines in their city water pipes, powers city by ...
There seems to be some confusion. The turbines are not in the shit water pipe, those are gravity powered and rarely reach max capacity. They are in the water main which is a pressure pipe with constant head coming from water towers. They have areas where they need to step the pressure down a bit, so they install these turbines instead of a pressure reducing valve. They don't actually get powered by turds.
3231
5695 :: Portland installs turbines in their city water pipes, powers city by ...
From what I remember the last time this topic appeared was that this turbines act as a pressure reduce due to a change greater then required change in elevation.

Meaning instead of putting in static pressure reducers they have instead installed these turbines.

Edit: the turbines are not in the sewer, they are in the water supply pipes

They are foreseeing a time when consumers no longer buy cars directly, but pay for a pick up service instead. Their ability to sell cars based on slick advertising and terrible financing will fail.

so many older folks disagree but they got addicted to their cars in college or earlier. So many friends of mine live in the cities and dont have licenses even in mid 20s due to good public trans. A parent is less likely to buy their kid a car when they go off to college, if they can just get them a reliable car service thats less dangerous, costly and worrisome.


people will grow up used to the idea and i think eventually some young people might think it is odd when people opt to own their own.

Personally, I like Lyft's app better than Uber's -- it's easier to find a car and communicate with drivers. I also prefer that Lyft gives me the ability to tip electronically. Also, I think Uber's CEO seems like a gross douchey loser. I think Lyft is slightly less expensive per ride, too. Uber's surge pricing is crazy sometimes, too.

However, all of that said, Uber tends to have more drivers at any given time than Lyft, so sometimes I'll go into the Lyft app, not see any drivers nearby, and switch to Uber and find someone. If Lyft can get more drivers on the road, then I don't know why anyone would ever prefer Uber. So, this seems like a good investment for Lyft.

The "good" news is that the changes that the article is referring to, while they're not legally able to be released yet, are possibly improving privacy, not making it worse. That would be a first.

Relevant quote: *"the PCLOB’s new compliance report, released on Saturday, found that the administration has submitted “revised FBI minimization procedures” that address at least some of the group’s concerns about “many” FBI agents who use NSA-gathered data.* But, as the Guardian points out,

6. "Wolfgang Schmidt was seated in Berlin's 1,200-foot-high TV tower, one of the few remaining landmarks left from the former East Germany. Peering out over the city that lived in fear when the communist party ruled it, he pondered the magnitude of domestic spying in the United States under the Obama administration. A smile spread across his face.

    'You know, for us, this would have been a dream come true,' he said, recalling the days when he was a lieutenant colonel in the defunct communist country's secret police, the Stasi. . . .

    . . . East Germany's Stasi has long been considered the standard of police state surveillance during the Cold War years, a monitoring regime so vile and so intrusive that agents even noted when their subjects were overheard engaging in sexual intercourse. Against that backdrop, Germans have greeted with disappointment, verging on anger, the news that somewhere in a U.S. government databank are the records of where millions of people were when they made phone calls or what video content they streamed on their computers in the privacy of their homes.

    Even Schmidt, 73, who headed one of the more infamous departments in the infamous Stasi, called himself appalled. The dark side to gathering such a broad, seemingly untargeted, amount of information is obvious, he said.

    'It is the height of naivete to think that once collected this information won't be used,' he said. 'This is the nature of secret government organizations. The only way to protect the people's privacy is not to allow the government to collect their information in the first place.' . . ."

My Netflix account got hacked last month. I wouldn't have suspected right away, but the fool changed the password and switched the language to Spanish. 
So I called them and got my shit back.

5679 :: Netflix black market sees passwords selling for just 25 cents
This happened to my account about a month ago and it freaked me out. 

I opened up my Netflix once and it said "continue watching how to be a murderer episode 10". It showed that I watched all episodes, yet I haven't seen even one. 

I went through my viewing history and there was a lot of suspicious activity. Lots of logins from various parts of Canada. 

I quickly contacted customer service and their only suggestion was to change my password. Nothing suspicious since but Netflix doesn't have any automated system to find out hacked accounts. They don't even have a way to alert you about new logins or 2 factor authentication. Lame

Someone hacked my account. Someone in France, I think. 

The thing is... I didn't mind someone using my account or even creating a profile with his list of movies, etc. (which he did).  It wouldn't have affected me one bit. Hell... I would have enjoyed sharing movie suggestions with this person. 

But he tried to change my password, changed the system language, and made other changes that attempted to take over my account. He would also block any of my attempts to reset everything to how I had it. I had to call Netflix and be on the phone with them for an hour. They had to eventually block his IP in order to give me enough time to change all of my information. 

If you're going to be a pirate, don't be an asshole about it. You may even end up finding a foreign friend.

this article ignores the fact that the same black market accounts may get resold hundreds of times, thus they are only usable for a few weeks before netflix automatically resets the password due to unnatural activity and the actual sub is forced to change the password or create a new more secure account.

this is why if you intend to pirate neflix, you have to get a reliable list-keeper who is willing to share a fresh list of name/pw at least once a month, and even then netflix could track and notice the os/hardware signature of your device keeps changing to a new accounts, and eventually ban that device for life.

Now that the fourth amendment has been rendered unenforceable, do you really still have a fourth amendment?

I think the answer is effectively no - the success of "parallel construction" (intelligence laundering) at bypassing the law and preventing accountability means that no-matter how blatantly or deliberately the fourth amendment is violated, there is no recourse for the victims and no consequences for the perps. It's as-good-as-legal in practice regardless of what is on paper. Basically, that constitutional right is gone. 

What we have instead is law-theater - courts and agencies all very studiously pretending to be doing their part and that law is being upheld, similar to the way that security-theater pretends to be doing security. Neither are the real thing - they instead function to keep up the comforting appearance of there being law / security.  (And often they're drinking their own or each-other's kool-aid.)

Edit: hey yall , I understand that pulling a misjudged innovation is a very good thing, and is the hallmark of a wise organization. My point was that the phrase "bookmark experience" sounds silly and buzzwordy when applied to such a specific action. Like if you operated a hotel and a door had squeaky hinges,  and you apologized for a "subpar door-opening experience". But yes,  Google is clearly paying attention to its users' feedback and taking action as necessary, which is good.

I was unreasonably happy when I discovered that I had the old manager back. Is it boring that my bookmarks basically appear like Windows Explorer expandable folders? Sure, but I can tell what things are at a glance and move things around as need be.

Also, the new version made my Mobile Bookmarks inaccessible except through looking at *all* my bookmarks. No idea why someone thought that was a good idea; clearly it wasn't due to technical limitations because I had access to them before. Google just decided that if I wanted to sort the bookmarks I made for my phone they should only be manageable on my phone.

Seems like they were making their interface touch-screen accessible. That's fine, but like many millions of people who own a PC, I use a goddamn mouse and keyboard; giant icons are a waste of my screen.

Small town Cop here. 

I just want to start off saying that I do support body cams, and having one would not make me do my job any differently. But there are things that need to be considered. So for anyone wondering "well if this study is true, why aren't all police wearing cameras". Let me explain:

First off the big one: cost. These systems are incredibly expensive. We just had training last month on body cams and concerns. If I get around to it I can even upload the PowerPoint we went through. Cost was a big one. For my department its just... Not possible. Our city council has to approve it. I mean shit they even took away funding for our dashcams in our cars. I mean it took until we had 30 minute response times from being shorthanded before they approved hiring an additional officer. They just don't see cameras as a use for us. Now we haven't had issues because of lack of cameras. Our officers do a great job. So it hasnt been an issue.... Yet. We would only need about... 5-10 cameras for our department. 10 if we each had our own. Or 5 if we did some kind of shared system. Our council still won't fund it. Now imagine a department the size of LA or NYPD funding it....

A second concern tied with cost is storage of the footage. Our county attorney determined that we would need to save the footage for 7 years. So anything we record saved for 7 years. Costs of storing that would be huge. 

Which brings me to the next point. What do we record? Do we record every call? From the time we get on to the time we get off? 12 hours of footage that might not even have anything on it? Do you wanna see my bathroom and coffee breaks? Or me sitting at the office on my phone? Only calls we go to? Only criminal calls? Medicals? HIPPA would have a hay day with medicals since we ask for practically their entire medical history. And the footage would have to be available to the public just like dash cams. What about juvenile calls? We can't release info on juveniles. Even in our reports we don't give DOB and use initials. That won't be the case in video. Do we pay someone to edit that out? Hire a new staff member just for video? What else could they edit out though?
 
There would need to be a huge department policy overhaul with the addition of cameras. Which isn't bad, but even after hypothetical approval from city council to purchase them, it would be at least another year before we get a policy in place and purchase, and train officers in the use of them.

Also if we did record everything another thing to note. People will hear officers talking amongst each other. We have a dark sense of humor. We might talk about a gruesome car accident like some people talk about Monday night football. People might take offense for that and start criticizing us based on that. 

Like I said I support the use of cameras. But there are tons of considerations that need to be made before everyone can be outfitted.

I'm actually really upset my agency wasn't mentioned in this report... Orlando, Tampa, and the Pasco Sheriff's Office have been working in tandem on getting this program up and running. However, at Pasco, every road deputy employed wears body cameras and incurs significant negative repercussion if they're not worn or not recording. Including termination if you refused. That's 500+ deputies wearing cameras, and I'm sure that number is low, I just don't know the actual number of sworn members off the top of my head. 

Overall, it's a love hate relationship. It costs my agency, which is considered federally as an extra large agency, millions each year. They're extremely tedious (recording, uploading, and tagging videos). They're inelegantly cumbersome with wires and bulky devices. They're constantly breaking and in need of fixing. There's constant software errors. Several male deputies have had to answer to their sergeants as to why they filmed their penises pissing (accidentally leaving it live). There's no perfect way to film, it's either on your head, shoulder, or neck. 

But... They keep the honest deputies safe and the dishonest in line. They reinforce positive public behavior and assist in record ways in incriminating criminal behavior. They captivate everyone into being "right" regardless of who you were before hand. They save careers. They save money. THEY SAVE LIVES. 

We'll never go back and frankly, I'm ok with that.

Prior to the attack the couple destroyed all their hard drives and other phones. They were well trained and had put a good deal of planning into the attack. They had been planning the attack for at least a year, probably longer. 

There's nothing on that phone. The FBI has no reason to think otherwise. They're simply using this is case to force Apple's hand. It's an election year and this case is confirmed terrorism. It's the best chance the FBI has to get away with using the terrorism card to full effect.

I didn't realize this was a government issued work phone.  There was clearly a failure on his employer to install proper device management.  I just asked the tech next to me who deploys our companies phones if not knowing the passcode would keep him from unlocking it.  Two clicks in his management tool and about a second for the command to propagate and my company iPhone had no passcode and anyone could get into it.

There's probably something on one of these phones that they want but they're leveraging terrorism to make Apple comply and get public opinion on their side.

This is pretty much what I've been thinking this whole time.  If they are connected to a huge terrorist network, you would not find those contacts on that phone.  they wouldn't even have used the phone for any correspondence whatsoever.  Doing so likely would have meant they would have been caught prior to the attack.

Unless the NSA is completely and utterly useless in every imaginable way, but why would we spend hundreds of billions of dollars and shred the constitution for an agency that doesn't even work, right.... RIGHT?
164

It's not about what's on the phone.  It's about free access to that and any other phone they want free access to.

I'm somewhat confused as well as to what they think they might find.

Any calls he sent/received could be retrieved from the cellphone provider.

Any message NUMBER sent/received could be retrieved from the cellphone provider.

I'm sure they already have access to his facebook and email accounts.

Unless he jailbroke the phone (unlikely since it was the country phone not his) he isn't going to have an "ISIS-COMMUNICATION" app installed.

The best they could get would be message data (assuming the provider can't provide that already) or files/binary content he sent/received.  Maybe his browser history, but that seems like a stretch, someone who wants to hide something enough to turn on wipe after 10 isn't going to leave sensitive things out there.

It seems like a fishing expedition looking for something, not that they know there is something.
47
5653 :: San Bernardino police: Reasonably good chance nothing of value on sho...
It's fairly obvious that the FBI doesn't give a shit what's on the phone. The attackers destroyed their other phones, where they would have kept the information the FBI would want. The FBI just wants the keys to all the iPhones.

[This](http://time.com/3850839/bernie-sanders-usa-patriot-act/) is what Bernie Sanders said about the PATRIOT Act:

>The surveillance law originally was passed by Congress in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I voted against it. I voted against reauthorizing the law in 2005 when I was still in the House and voted “no” again in 2011 in the Senate when Congress passed the most-recent four-year extension of the law. I believed then and am even more convinced today that the law gave the government far too much power to spy on Americans and that it provided too little oversight or disclosure.

5629 :: Artist who painted Facebook's first office and asked for stock instea...
Dave Choe once interviewed me for a job that he did not have the ability to give me.

**Edit:**
I went in for an interview at this startup, in a small office, and as I was waiting for someone to come and get me, he basically fell, Kramer-style, out through his office door and was like, "Hey, what's up?" To which I said, "Hey, I'm here for an interview?"

He was like, "Oh, great, great, so do you have a resume and stuff?" and I said I did, so he took it out and looked over it, we talked about it some... He asked if I had a portfolio, and I said I had some of my work from college online, so he took me to a computer and we looked at that for a while, and basically I gave him the full shpiel.

After talking for maybe 10 minutes or so, he said something along the lines of, "Well, let's find someone to interview you," (to my confusion, because I thought he was interviewing me) and he basically knocked on the CEO's door and was like, "Hey man, this guy wants an interview." He kinda prodded me on inside and then I had to do it all over again. It was good practice. I got the job.

Dave was running art direction for the company (the founder/my boss was his old buddy) and we worked together for a few months after that. When he left, I had to clean out his desk and computer for a new hire. The desk was filled with liquor; the computer was filled with porn.

EDIT: I'm not a car guy but I see a lot of you arguing about 2.8 and 3.1 seconds to hit 60mph. The point you are bringing up is whether this was a rolling 5mph start or a full 0-60.

Going from 0-60 IS quicker than going 5-60 in a gasoline powered car, has this changed with electric vehicles?

Gender aside, the takeaway here could be anything from gender to race to I just don't like you.  It can be abused and I have seen it abused time and time again.  Co-workers sabotaging teammates just to get a higher rank than you.  The don't need to win the race but just beat one person.  It is a horrific way to evaluate your employees.

Wow, lots of people in the comments here missing the real story beyond the gender discrimination angle. Yahoo's performance evaluation system has gutted their employee morale at all levels much like a similar system did to Microsoft until recently.

I found this article on the lawsuit from the NYT covers the subject in more depth:

>Anderson says that although his offer letter specified his employment was "at will, he says "it did so dismissively, as if a mere perfunctory obligation, and it introduced the subject with the phrase 'We interrupt this fantastic offer with a word from our lawyers.'" The offer letter included  language like "You'll be investing your time with us, and we are ready to invest in you." It had the cumulative effect of leading Anderson to believe he wouldn't be terminated "without some just reason honestly held."

Wait. What? Did they literally send out a letter which contained the phrase: 'We interrupt this fantastic offer with a word from our lawyers.'? That's a little weird, right? Its not just me?

Until the DCMA law is modified, they need to have this instant takedown system in place to avoid major lawsuits. There are ways they can improve this current system though. 

Put ad revenue during a claim into escrow. Currently if Nintendo claims your video they instantly from making that claim get all of the ad revenue from it during the claim process. Even if they lose that claim they still keep that revenue. 

Punish false claims. there is no punishment for false claims. none. There are stories of people claim every single video of a channel, waiting the 30 day period and just letting it expire. They get all of that revenue. Or they can have a video taken down and by the time it is release its no longer a relevant topic. 

Pay for a department to handle claims. A group of people that content creators can call and email and get a real non form letter response. I would prefer every claim be looked at by a human but with the scope of youtube that is impossible. Most claims are legitimate and don't get fought anyways. For the ones that are disputed though, people need some sort of tools beyond a 250 character box for a legal defense. 
587
5598 :: YouTube CEO says 'we're listening' to growing criticisms of complaint...
Here's an idea for a fix: YouTube doesn't have to rely on any corrective mechanisms for flawed DMCA takedown claims that are provided by the DMCA itself. It can impose its own.  
If you file a lame takedown request which is later appealed, any future takedown requests are automatically placed at the end of the queue of all takedown requests.  
If you file 2 bogus takedowns? You can't file takedowns anymore.  

That'd probably work.
Or, at least help.

TL;dR: YouTube can be *harsher* than the DMCA when it comes to people abusing the DMCA.  (I want to stay at the DMCA!)

Edit: Okay -- After reading a bunch of comments, I'd like to incorporate some suggestions into the fix.  
As /u/DrTBag said:

>If a company issues 1 mullion requests and none of them are false it will still be free and issued immediately. If another company issues 100 and they're all false their future claims would be delayed while investigated and only applied if they are genuine. 

How about this? If you're a copyright troll or some other sleazebag, and a bunch of your DMCA takedown-requests to YouTube are successfully appealed, or found to be legitimate fair use, then your only recourse for asking YouTube to take down a video is via US Mail, or other fairly expensive form of communication.  
You don't get to email them anymore.  
If you're sending hundreds and hundreds of takedown requests, and you had to spend USD $0.49 for a stamp for each request, you might think twice.  

"Due to the number of takedown requests you have filed which have been successfully appealed in the past, in order to better document your actions, we regretfully inform you that future takedown requests filed under §512(b)-(d) be done so in writing. Please print out your takedown request and send it via US Mail (certified mail is preferred) to  

    YouTube
    Silicon Valley, USA 
    Earth

Thank you for using YouTube!"

I read a little of the DMCA language, and it looks like there's an ambiguous "or" in the language:  

>The notification is in writing, signed physically or electronically by a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright allegedly infringed.  

I am not a lawyer. But there seems to be some wiggle room there. If the notification has to be "in writing," it seems a provider could demand an actual piece of paper with writing on it.  

Seriously, the 49 cent stamp could fix a lot of this.

This statement is so bullshit. It doesnt address any of the points at all. They are saying "we will try to reduce mistakes" when it is not mistakes that are the problem, but the policy and system itself. Ads that get takedowns should not automatically redirect monetisation to the issuer, it should go to escrow for 30 days until appeal is exausted.

5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
I work for a company that repairs iPhones and we refurbish thousands of iPhone 6. We have tried everything under the sun to get around this error but it is simply not possible. If someone brings in an iPhone 6 for repair and the home button is damaged in any way, we tell them up front the phone is unrepairable and we won't take it.

5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
I like how the guy got it repaired, got it bricked for no good reason, is furious, and then in the next sentence bought another iPhone.  What kind of a person does that?
3831
5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
I do a lot of iOS device repairs. I've logged over 11,000 repairs now on iPhones and iPads mostly over the last three years. I'm super careful and rarely make mistakes, but they do happen. The home button cable for the TouchID is extremely fragile on the iPad Mini 3. Slightly lifting it wrong can tear that cable and you're stuck buying the customer a new iPad instead of replacing the cable or button. This just happened to me. It's infuriating to lose all profit for a day because of a problem that could be handled much better.

Apple says this is due to security and I agree, there shouldn't be repairs that should be able to be done on TouchID. However, if you replace the button, iOS should default to making you use your passcode. You lose Apple Pay &amp; TouchID. Your phone is still secure. Anyone saying Apple can't do this is blind if they think one of the biggest tech giants can't make that software change instead of what seems retribution for not getting serviced through them, which coincidentally costs way more $$$.
105
5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
I think it's reasonable not to allow touch ID repairs for security.  Otherwise what's the point.

However it should still work with the pin code...  That's a step over the line.

edit: For people saying that there was no warning. When touch ID was introduced, Apple stated it required a pairing between the home button and secure enclave. Repair shops found a way around this which was the start to this (ending with this unfairly punishing outcome).
729
5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
I'm sure it's infuriating, but when I read to the end of the article I found Apple's explanation for the error:

> A spokeswoman for Apple told Money (get ready for a jargon overload): 

> “We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. 

> When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. 

> This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. 

> **Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted,** thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. [emphasis mine]

> When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.”

> She adds: “When an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. 

> With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an ‘error 53’ being displayed … If a customer encounters an unrecoverable error 53, we recommend contacting Apple support.”

I'm not excusing the lack of a fix, but the issue seems valid.

Edit to say, thanks for all the replies, and many good points were made. My final thought on this is that Apple seems to have forgotten we all vote with our wallets, and they aren't even the dominant vendor. 
1511
5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
If I can unlock my phone using my passcode instead of Touch ID, then 'if' the sensor becomes compromised the phone needs a graceful procedure for turning off the touch sensor and relying only on passcode.  
  
"Your touch sensor is not functioning properly or is not original, so the touch sensor is disabled. Please contact Apple support.  You may only unlock your device with the passcode"
  
Food for thought - what if my touch sensor gets damaged in a solo car accident - am I unable to use my phone to call for help

5589 :: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill you...
This is happening with official (Apple website listed) repair shops in Brazil. 

According to brazilian laws, the manufacturer will need to exchange the device for a newer one/unused if it turned useless after some kind of official update, for free. 

Same with planned obsolence.  Apple recently was plead guilty for making older phones 'run slower making them infuriating to use' with new updates and some customers got new models after a lawsuit. 

They can't disable your phone because it was fixed by a third party, since their official support availability is scarce here. The only thing they can do is cancel your warranty/extended warranty. 

You phone got bricked? Demand your exchange.

I used to work in IP at Viacom before youtube and user created content. Viacom trademarked their logos and brands literally worldwide, including small African countries. We had to go through law firms in each of these countries and sometimes the trademark process took much longer and was more stringent than in the U.S. or Canada. But they didn't stop other networks from playing music videos although they owned hundreds of trademarks for MTV and MTV Music Television.

I wonder if the Fine Brothers are actually trademarking their brands in individual countries, because it's very costly and can take years to pass, or since Youtube is an American company do they just trademark in the U.S. and can still block content created and uploaded in other countries? The trademark field is so much more complex than when I worked in it because of globalization and the internet.

"Pro" photographer here and I can't vouch enough for these plug-ins. I tell any aspiring photographer about them if they'll listen. I have been using them for years in both aperture (when in the office) and in lightroom (pc laptop) and it absolutely kicks ass. It is an absolute time saver when processing photos with things like white balance correction, contrast changes, vignette effects and so on. That's the way I see it, as a time saving tool. It's not magical, it won't fix your poorly composed or terribly lit photos but it will sure help your good photos look even better in a couple clicks. You can manually do all the things this software does in Photoshop in 30 clicks and menu pull downs but who the hell has time for that. Anyways those are my two cents.

It's ok, we'll get there.

Edit: It's already very hard to pull off a suicide burn with a first stage the length of the Falcon's and an engine like the Merlin. Landing on a barge is already pretty hard because of tangential forces of the sea and at touchdown. Let's not forget they're trying something incredibly difficult. Hopefully we know they can land on solid ground.

I've always liked this quote attributed to Banksy about ads in public spaces

>People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.

>“You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

>“Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

>“You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”

Whereas companies in the business of selling web-ads have a long tradition reaching back all the way to the late 90s in some cases.

It should perhaps be pointed out that the Internet with all the geeks and weirdos came first and advertisements and SPAM came later.

The first it is the advertising industry who is the intruder here, the Net wasn't build by them or for them. They have no moral right to it.

Just for perspective the first instance of internet advertising was probably the [Greencard USENET spammers which started in 1994.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Siegel)

This is something that happened in my lifetime, and not ancient history.

What he & his colleagues refuse to accept is that in any field things are changing constantly & changing rapidly. Those who do not embrace change & learn to handle it to their advantage will eventually bite the dust. What this "leader" should do is get his industry peers to think about innovation & how to have a better relationship with his customers in a way that benefits both sides, instead of trying to steamroller his customers into submission.

As long as people are happy with the toys placed inside the sandbox (aka consumption), they'll never leave the sandbox.

> As in the TPP, and expanding on the earlier leaked draft, TISA also includes a prohibition on laws that require service providers to host data locally, which some countries have used to protect sensitive personal information, such as health data, from being snooped upon on foreign soil.

> There are arguments for and against such laws, and it is inappropriate that a secretive international agreement such as TISA should preempt these important debates.

> The closed-door TISA negotiations are designed to set some very technologically-specific rules in stone-rules that will bind signatory countries for decades to come.

These people have decided that they've had it with democracy because it won't give them what they want.

One of the effective ways of stopping that is to buy stock in  companies seeking those treaties and voicing concerns as a stock holder.

That's insanely impressive from a cash flow angle.  They basically got a 2 year 325mil loan for free. 

Edit: TIL A shocking number of Reddits has trouble with multiplication. 325,000 deposits x $1000 = $325 million. Stop messaging me about that.

Edit2: The money is not held in escrow. From the agreement:

>“You understand that Tesla may not have completed the development of Model 3 or begun manufacturing Model 3 at the time of your reservation. You also acknowledge that, if you purchase a Model 3, the Model 3 may not be delivered to you until the end of 2017 or later. You also agree that we will not hold your Reservation Payment separately or in an escrow or trust fund or pay any interest on Reservation Payments.”

5559 :: Tesla Model 3 reservations now stand at 325,000
Obviously people want the car, but you do have to wonder how many of those preorders are from speculators. When a car is heavily desired and has a limited production it is not uncommon for people to buy them solely with the intent to flip them, like with the Hellcat. 

Since the deposit is completely refundable, you have to wonder how many people are preordering simply because of speculation.

I'm an Engineer for a luxury brand manufacturer and have been following Tesla for a number of years. I've been impressed with what they have been able to accomplish from the R&D side but I can tell you first hand that actually producing them is going to be an enormous challenge (not that it wasn't already known). Ramping up is simply not a matter of what you can handle at the final assembly facility but also at supplier factories. Not to mention that even speeding up the assembly line by only 10 seconds can take months of preparation, not only from the human assembly standpoint but also from the body welding and paint robot side.  Ramping up is typically done in steps across a long period of time to be able to monitor end quality accurately. I would be blown away if they could produce 100,000 plus units within the next year and half without having major quality control issues. Training man power takes time, planning manufacturing machinery with anticipation of future production additions to avoid bottlenecks takes time, waiting for suppliers to ramp up takes time. Tesla will slowly but surely take a solid piece of the market, but they are nowhere close to threatening well established manufacturers who already have facilities and money in place. I really do wish them all the best, they are challenging how we think about transportation and as we all know competition breeds excellence.

Net neutrality has broad public support, even among republican voters. How can these guys get away with this?

For fucks sake already. Just let every municipality start up their own ISPs and have the backbones forced to allow each one equal access at the same cost already.

Each could operate at cost or slightly above to allow for future expansion/upgrades and we'd all have cheaper and better access.
28
5565 :: Democrats vow to save net neutrality in budget fight with Republicans...
 Corporations don't like rules established at the behest of the American public? No problem the Republicans have a plan! Just defund the agency so they can't enforce net neutrality.

There should be no question about it anymore. Republicans and Democrats are both shit, but republicans absolutely and without question have no concern about the people. The GOP are entirely devoted to corporate interests and they hardly try to hide it anymore.

How the hell can Republicans justify being against net neutrality? It literally is the fundamental pillar for **competition** between ISPs, wireless carriers, backhaul/distribution carriers, content delivery networks, etc. Republicans usually jerk off to the free market except and until a market requires regulation to actually maintain competition (finance, telco, power, health care, higher education).

Beyond that, satphones are expensive *especially* when it comes to power useage. Wifi calling uses lines owned, operated and maintained by telcos.

This was already supposed to be a thing back in the late 90s.  I worked for Motorola on the Iridium satellite phone network while it was being developed and near the end, all anybody would talk about was the next generate Teledesic (nee Celestri) satellite Internet network.  Motorola was springboard off of the massive success of Iridium onto Teledesic.

Heh... yeah.  "Massive success."  They had insane expectations for Iridium that couldn't possibly be fulfilled and with the staggering losses they suffered, they couldn't even begin to do any real work on Teledesic.  It died before it ever got off the ground (literally).

Technologically, though, it was absolutely feasible even back then.  Motorola had gotten quite good at launching satellites so launching a bunch more for Internet absolutely would have worked.  It was just the money part that couldn't be made to work at all.

Wonder if Musk can make it work financially.  Seems... dubious.

I'm 52 and I think I'm doing fairly well keeping up with consumer tech. But whenever I try to do something useful on iTunes on my laptop, I wonder for a minute if perhaps I don't actually know how to use computers, or maybe I did know how to but have recently had the knowledge of those skills removed by a brain aneurysm that I've forgotten about.

Preview isn't great. But its problems are peanuts next to iTunes, iMovie, Mail or such.

I wouldn't call myself an Apple fan, though I do own several of their products. I can safely say that iTunes is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever had the misfortune of using. That and it seems every iOS update makes my devices slower, that is when it isn't bricking them.

I hate how they decide there's a better way to do things and take away the ability to do it the way you're used to. Like, in Preview, they took away the ability to switch to the hand tool because you can do those functions with multi-touch. Fuck you. I like using a mouse. And not that stupid magic mouse that feels like holding a fucking playing card. You can hold option-space bar to use the hand tool, but that's a bitch when I'm zoomed in on a wiring schematic and tracing wires all over the place.

I remember when Steve Jobs said something like people want devices that just work. They seem to have forgotten that. The user experience is really more and more painful with every update.

5551 :: Apple takes its eye off the ball: Why Apple fans are really coming to...
I am a long-time Unix user who happily moved from Linux to Mac OS X quite some time ago.   I have not seen the stability problems mentioned in the article, but I definitely think the usability of Mac OS X and iOS has peaked and has been getting noticeably worse over the last couple years.

Unintuitive applications and features along with obscure UX is increasingly bad.  As someone with decades of experience and a computer science degree, I have a fighting chance to work out how to make the device do what I want.  Trying to explain it to my parents is a lost cause.

To me, it seems like Apple has too many UX people, all tasked with making improvements.  The net effect is 'change for the sake of change'.   My parents knew how to search on their early iPhones.  Now, it's "slide down on the screen and it will show a search input".  WTF?  It's not intuitive, and there are dozens of examples of more of this.

The merging of iOS concepts into Mac apps is also a disaster.   "Photos" is garbage.  Change for the sake of change.  It doesn't work well as a desktop app.

I don't understand why things are going wrong. Apple employs over 100,000 people. They can't ALL be incompetent. What the fuck is Tim Cook doing? Anyone on reddit could point out a dozen things they don't like about Apple. So why isn't anything being fixed?
220
5551 :: Apple takes its eye off the ball: Why Apple fans are really coming to...
I don't *hate* Apple software, but a lot of it feels like late beta rather than a final release.  It's not like Steve Jobs never allowed software to be shipped that wasn't feature complete or had problems (MobileMe, anyone?), but it feels like there's a lot of it these days.

Maybe the best way to put it is that I spend more time these days looking forward to the next OS releases to fix problems rather than to add new functionality.
283
5551 :: Apple takes its eye off the ball: Why Apple fans are really coming to...

I got a sony smartwatch 3 for $70 after discounts and I have been very happy with it.

Built in GPS, Bluetooth, NFC, 4GB of storage for music and waterproof  (IP68: 30 min up to one meter. Water resistant is a more accurate term)

Being able to see all of my alerts while i am working without touching my phone has been nice.

Turn by turn directions on my wrist when I am walking downtown also helps me not look like I am lost.

Being able to use it to pay for stuff is also going to be cool.

I often misplace my phone in my house so being able to just flick my wrist and set off the alarm on my phone is nice too.

No one will ever need a smartwatch but they are not useless.

Edit:

Wanted to add some notes on the sony smartwatch 3.

The glass scratches kinda easy, I am kinda clumsy so that may be a factor. 

The transflective display works well in the sun.

If you don't modify the clasp (bend it) it will pop if you clap your hands hard.

Added details about water resistance rating. People pointed out water resistant was a more accurate term.

I bought an Apple Watch a week ago. I'm a type 1 diabetic and I can take a glance at my wrist to see what my blood glucose via integration with my Continuous Glucose Monitor. I understand that not everyone will have a niche use like this, but to me it makes a world of difference to simply flick my wrist to check the number that governs the steps I take to survive every day. 

That being said, I can definitely tell that I am using a first generation device. The processor is slow. The apps (especially 3rd party) have periods where they can't share data with the phone. As a medical device, I think the Apple Watch could be a major game changer as the hardware becomes more sophisticated and the software more mature. 

With rumors of the Apple Watch 2 being announced in June, it is tempting to return the watch and buy the next one, which I expect to iron out the annoyances I have with the first model. But whether or not I do return this model, I will most certainly be picking up the Apple Watch 2. It's just too nice to see my blood glucose level without digging my phone out of my pocket. I also love being able to easily access my todo list and triage tasks from my wrist. Time travel is super cool. I think the watch is quite beautiful. It just doesn't feel like it lives up to what it can be quite yet. I also hope that future versions can rely on the phone for less things.

Edit: Clarification.

Don't wear a watch, so why would I wear a smart watch that is just an "extension" (pocket to wrist) of my phone?

I like this quote from Steve Wozniak about why people buy jewelry;

> I worry a little bit about – I mean I love my Apple Watch, but – it’s taken us into a jewelry market where you’re going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person.

I have an apple watch and I love it. I use 70% of the battery through general use everyday, and charge it over night. I use it to change songs as I always have my phone in my pocket. I use it to buy my lunch at work through apple pay without having to go to my locker to grab my phone (I work in a supermarket). I keep my phone in my pocket a lot of the time and only take it out if I need to reply, otherwise my watch lets me read messages I receive. It really doesn't deserve the hate and I don't think it's a gimmick.

People don't need a lot of what they buy. Nobody "needs" a smartphone. The human race got on quite
nicely without them for a very, very long time. 

Nobody needs televisions. 
Or game consoles.
Nobody needs ice cream. 
Or beer. 
Nobody needs cars that have heated seats or sunroofs.
Nobody needs Reddit. 

The world is full of things nobody needs. It's strange to single out this particular product. 

I think what you mean is that the majority of people have not found it compelling enough to buy. Myself included. But not everything has to be for everyone. 

Appealing to a small segment of the population as a niche/status product is not uncommon, and in fact many of these products command huge prices and high loyalty. Check out niche cars and high end designer handbags. 

But then, of the millions who have bought one, something like 70% say they like it enough to buy the next generation. If that's how me measure failure, I need to start failing harder. 

You're right, nobody needs one. Lots of people so apparently want one though, and are willing to spend for it.

I just got a Pebble a few weeks back. I like it OK. Mainly I like having the weather on my wrist, and seeing what that alarm is for (and dismissing it) without having to dig my phone out of my pocket.

Also the "ring" speaker on my Nexus is dead now, repair attempts have failed, and spending $70 on the Pebble kept me from having to buy a new phone, at least temporarily, because I don't need an audible ringer (actually I kind of prefer it this way - I think even when I get a new phone I'll just leave it on silent at all times, so only I know that the phone is ringing).

All that said, Apple watches are way too expensive. Also, I think they're ugly even compared to the cheapest $70 Pebble, and the Pebble has a 7 day battery life. It's ridiculous to have to charge a watch every day.

In light of what's come out about Microsoft actively and voluntarily assisting the government to decrypt messages sent via its products, it would be interesting if the government was actually encouraging decisions such as this, as well as companies such as Apple to publicly oppose such government requirements, all as a ruse to suggest that the government can't read encrypted messages because these companies aren't cooperating, and can't be forced to, when they really are, and the government already has unfettered access.

ELI5 summary here:

Scientists taught a computer how to recognize certain types of images, like dogs or houses, by giving it thousands of pictures for it to look at. The computer got so good at telling what those things were, that the scientists wondered if it could create something which *we* would recognize as that thing. 

The scientists asked the computer to look at a picture and find some shapes that it thought looked the tiniest bit like a dog, just like when we stare at a cloud and imagine that it's a dinosaur. Then, and this is where the real magic happened, it would make that area look just a little bit MORE like a dog. It did this over and over, each time doing the same thing, and each time making those shapes look more dog-like. Eventually those areas that the computer thought looked a little bit like a dog, started to look a LOT like a dog, and we saw dogs everywhere!

Says nothing about the police. The police have been using them too and then claiming ignorance because of their "NDA with FBI" (as if that has any actual legal meaning in this case). So will the police still be able to use it without warrants?

5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
Does anyone actually believe that they'll abide by these requirements? Stingrays are notoriously used for the shady practice of [parallel construction](https://privacysos.org/node/1427), whereby cops would obtain evidence illegally with one of these things and then create a different, legal path to the same evidence after it had already been gathered. It got to the point where local DAs were dropping cases when the use of the Stingray was at risk of being exposed.

There appears to be a culture of corruption surrounding these things. They basically give god mode surveillance powers to the agents using them, and multiple levels of government have conspired to keep their uses hidden in the past. So what's to stop multiple levels internal to the FBI from conspiring to abuse these things like they've always done? Why should we trust them with this technology *at all*?
46
5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
Not a stingray fish. In case anyone was stupid enough to think that. I totally didn't think that at first....
220
5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
My guess is that they'll just enter into some type of "cooperative arrangement" with the local police and have the local police use the Stingray instead of using it directly.
18
5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
>FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays

They will still continue to use them without warrants, it's just if the source of the evidence is confirmed to have come from illegal use of the stingrays it's inadmissible in court. The jury will still hear it anyway despite the judge telling them to ignore it and the law will lie about it's true source, claiming a "anonymous source" told them.

Try to get a case overthrown for prosecutor misconduct? Have the police turn on each other for you? Good luck there bubba.


76
5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
"Have to?"  More like a sternly worded suggestion.

The federal agencies will just have to get their stingray info from local police now.  Or else, they'll have to continue to get it themselves and be *really* careful about covering it up... which they've already been doing.
6
5497 :: FBI, DEA and others will now have to get a warrant to use stingrays
They need to have a warrant to use stingrays if they intend for the information gathered to hold up in court. Using their "parallel construction" bullshit I doubt they will stop using these anytime soon.

Another thing I notice is that at 10, Apple's P/E is ridiculously low for a company with such strong profit performance and long history of both success and growth.  And again if you back out their financial investments, it is outright absurd.  So Apple could have a good strong run again.

A big issue I see in the markets today is that we're undervaluing performance, fundamentals, and flexibility more and more to chase nonsensical growth targets.  This is going to become an increasing issue because we've stagnated quite a bit in technology, particularly consumer technology, here in the 2010s.  

But the good news that market movers should see is that while consumers/small investors have struggled to save, intelligent companies have not and are well poised to try and break this stagnation.

The market needs to have the strength to trust allowing these companies leeway on growth to encourage next-gen R&D or unexpected / risk-reward type product releases.  It needs to escape the cycle of impatience.  To fail to do so risks a major economic downturn IMO.

He's a federal district judge, not part of the FISA court. He has no more access to the NSA's classified programs than anyone else.

Just because a judge says something in court does not give it extra validity. Working for the government doesn't mean you have access to everything it does.

That being said, we know the truth about PRISM from the leaks. This changes nothing.

The sad part is that the NSA/FBI/other 3/4 letter agencies have become extra-governmental.  Funded by the U.S. Tax dollars?  Probably, but maybe not.  Is a new President fully informed about whats going on in the agencies?  Do the congressional committees that "oversee" these entities fully know what is going on?  If they do, and object are their nudie pics with their girlfriend/boyfriend being used to silent them?  Many people on reddit think the government is the solution to many/all problems.  History has proved time and again the centralized power corrupts.  People should strive to have the least amount of government necessary to maintain a polite/successful society.

It's not actively dissolving - it's fucking dead. 

Because of CISA passing as a ride-along to a spending bill last week, all of your content providers now share your information with the US government - without a warrant - and are immune from any lawsuit that you could bring against them for sharing said information. 

On top of that Everyone in the [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) actively spy on each other's populaces and share said information. 

*All* of your banking information, health records, emails, phone call 'metadata', your text messages, Facebook posts, app usage information, *everything* is being harvested because of 'terrorism'. 

Now you hear fuck-whits like Hillary saying we need 'Manhattan project' for encryption - and other clueless "representatives" saying we need back doors, or golden keys - which are *both stupid, STUPID fucking ideas*. (If it exists it will be exploited).  The sad thing is, this too will fall because they will continue to do wahtever they want. 

So much for due process and 'inalienable' rights...

Well fuck the people spying on something that need not be spied on. Fuck the people who say they need more access. They already have it, and they ignore the information till it's too late. And then people die. And when they die it is used to further bullshit agendas like this. 
So it's self perpetuating. And they don't have a problem with it. 
This is how a revolution starts, and how Americans take back their nation from the dick weeds running the government who enjoy payouts and enjoy running this once amazing nation into the damn ground. 
My buddies didn't die so this shit could happen. But it happens and when Americans raise up the government not need to look to me for help. I have a family I worry about everyday. And now I worry about the government doing harm to my family and my way of life more than any other external force.
I'm broken and permenently disabled. I would love to see some shit ass politicians do what I did so someone else can get rich and invade their privacy and wipe their ass with the constitution.

This could be blatant manipulation of the masses for all I know, that's the state of the internet we live in now. The fourth branch of the government(AKA the media) controls everything on TV. How do I, an average redditor know that the mods or admins are not being bought or paid off to show certain news sources over others? You all talk about how we are losing freedom but there is some serious astroturfing(forgive me if that's not the right word) in regards to politics and what reaches the front page on this site.(Every good guy obama news story that reaches the front page conveniently when he is trying to pass unpopular opinions.)

It's funny how people are constantly discovering price discrimination around them and getting all bent out of shape about it. Guess what? It doesn't really "cost" the airline 300% more for the seat in First Class. They charge that much because sometimes rich people are willing to pay a lot more for something that's just a little better.

And there's no law or rule that the cost of manufacture needs to have any relationship to its price. When I buy a copy of Photoshop at retail, I'm literally getting a $0.02 jewel case and a $0.01 DVD. But that's a silly way to look at it.

I know this will be just another drop in the bucket.

That forces you to either buy a very expensive large storage option or buy a semi-cheaper storage option and use a cloud. The cloud isn't always a viable option and not always easy to access. 


iphone has never had micro SD (I think?), then all of a sudden Samsung and Motorola have gone with the trend. It's super upsetting and I'm definitely going to only look at phones or companies that still offer a micro SD slot.

TCPA legislation is ridiculous and it basically prevents the use of auto dialers for anything including texting or calling you when explicit consent is given. Look up some of the lawsuits on this stuff it's bull. For instance if you give PayPal your number and explicit consent to text it and lets say you fat fingered it and they text the wrong number. That's a $1500-$5000 fine for them for ONE mistake and that's not including legal costs when someone sues them for it. And there are a TON of scumbags suing for this right now.

The next-up version of their ToA doesn't seem to change anything either (same wording, to the letter). So I'd suggest you guys take a bit of your time to read the Terms of your respective country, which might differ depending on its Internet/Privacy laws.

If you think it's just the FBI that's engaging in activities like this, guess again.  All the three letter agencies are acting in ways so contrary to americans' interests it makes you put your tin foil hat on.  For example, let's look at this lawsuit filed against the EPA in 2009 that is still working its way through the courts.  Basically in 2006 the EPA was supposed to put laws in place to protect children from pesticide drift.  They admit to this and they also admit they haven't done it but environmental groups are having to sue the EPA to do it.  BY LAW (FIFRA and FQPA), the EPA is supposed to protect kids from pesticide drift and we are having to sue the EPA so that they actually uphold the law because of regulatory capture.

This is the first level in the court system, and the copyright organisations has already filed for an appeal. Seeing how this is the first Swedish case of its kind it will likely end up in the supreme court eventually.

Still, it's hopeful that the district court rules in favor of the ISP. Swedish copyright laws are not intended for blockering websites, so the rightholders have to prove that the ISP is an accessory to copyright crime which some experts believe could set a dangerous precedent where ISP:s can be ordered to block pretty much anything unlawful that happens online (the ISP in question has said they might be forced to block Facebook because of illegal threats and racist comments).

How about EMT drones that deliver suture supplies and AEDs while paramedics are in route? 

Crime is at an all time low. Why are we arming police departments with crazy advanced tools? Especially North Dakota with it's population of less than a million people. So don't say it's an unmanageable population amount. 

Edit: Yes the population of ND is spread out and very rural which creates difficulties for tradition policing methods, however my position is I believe if we were to invest in drones for the public good I feel a more multipurpose EMT/Search and Rescue/ Forrest Fire assessment tooled drone would be of greater benefit.

We're pretty effective at hunting people and catching them. We have a lot of room to grow as far as Emergency response time and advanced tools for those types of causes.

The bill they passed doesn't "authorize" much of anything.

Before, there was no legislation detailing what could or could not be put on drones. Now, there is legislation in ND that says they can't put lethal weapons on drones. If anything, the law got more restrictive, not less.

The article also doesn't say how many ND law enforcement agencies are flying armed drones, or if there are any at all.

If an officer asks you to empty your pockets and you refuse, that does NOT constitute probable cause to search you.  Likewise, taking steps to protect your anonymity does NOT constitute probable cause for a search.  This should be very much illegal.

I feel for law enforcement, their job has become very difficult lately, but that does not justify the gross violation of the rights of the innocent.  This is a clear violation of the US Constitution 4th amendment rights against unreasonable searches.  Refusing to be searched is not probable cause for a search.

Edit: As has been pointed out, I misinterpreted the article.  Having now read the actual law, the issue is more about jurisdiction.  This law would give law enforcement the legal power to hack into a computer without getting a warrant from a judge in the jurisdiction where your computer is if they don't know where your computer is.  There are some international problems with this (it's giving law enforcement a legal basis for hacking into computer in, say France, without asking for the French government's permission).  

Another problem is that, even if you are in the USA, if you use anonymous services, law enforcement could, potentially, use any judge to grant a warrant, not just the one in charge of your district (ie, they can ask for a warrant from a judge in a district where they are more likely to say yes).  

So, this law would make it *easier* for law enforcement to get a warrant if you're using anonymizing services, but the use of those services alone still would not constitute probable cause.  They just now have to prove probable cause with the minimum/most-lax standard, rather than the standard of where you live.

5465 :: Tor and VPN users will be target of government hacks under new spying...
If I have an option to opt out of location tracking, use VPN or Tor. Nobody has and should not have a right to forcefully know who/what/where I am regardless of my social status, gender, race, nationality OR force these options to be enabled or be publicly known that I am using it or know exactly I am behind this VPN or Tor exit node.

This is pure discrimination from the government to turn any person into a "so-called potential" terrorist. For fuck's sake government, you can amass money from virtually anywhere, but instead of opting to a much smarter monitoring of the outer spaces, you opt for the cheaper but ultra-intrusive hacking into VPNs and Tor nodes because we have a reason to be hidden and should be hidden from anyone unless we give a consent to that.

5465 :: Tor and VPN users will be target of government hacks under new spying...
I pay for and use a VPN hoping that some day the government will decrypt a small portion of my logged traffic and see how boring my life is.  It's depressing when you think about how much of our tax dollars are going to programs like this.
466
5465 :: Tor and VPN users will be target of government hacks under new spying...
What people here are misunderstanding is that this gives judges the possibility to issue a warrant on a computer of which they do not know the location because it is using something like TOR or a VPN. This doesn't mean that usage of TOR or a VPN are valid reasons for a warrant, it just means that if a valid reason for a warrant were found then that warrant could be executed even if law enforcement has no clue what jurisdiction the device is in.

So, I use a VPN to access my sites when on public WIFI to keep my connections all private...so I'll be a target all of a sudden?

5465 :: Tor and VPN users will be target of government hacks under new spying...
Just so we're all on the same page, this new rule is not a new authorization for federal authorities to look into Tor and VPNs. Rather, this is the Supreme Court loosening a warrant application requirement.  

It used to be that you had to file a warrant application in the jurisdiction where you planned to conduct the search. This new rule will allow the warrant application to be filed in any jurisdiction if you are trying to remotely search a computer and don't know its physical location.

So, assuming that remote computer searches can ever be ok, this rule change is making it so these can be realistically accomplished.

This is clearly a reaction to the decision in U.S. v. Levin, where a district court judge in Massachusetts suppressed evidence from that FBI sting operation where they ran a child porn site. [See here.](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/21/fbi-mass-child-porn-hack-ruled-illegal-on-a-technicality/)

But you see, it's being violated all the time. 

And for those of you who are 'gun control' advocates actively undermining the 2nd ammendment, ask yourself how you like losing the 4th (and 5th in parallel). And if you think the assault on the 1st isn't underway, with so called safe spaces and proposed hate speech laws, you are not paying attention. 

There can be no liberty without privacy - and yes, we've already lost a huge amount of liberty we may never get back. It isn't big and it isn't clever to call this 'tin foil hatted nonsense' either.

They used burner phones. The idea is that if you buy in cash and only use it for an hour or whatever then nobody will know it is you. 

Encryption is something you run when everyone knows it's you and you don't want them to know anything else. Like on your daily use smartphone. In the article it says the police are suggesting that finding no emails is evidence of encryption, which is lunacy. Just in case you're not very technical but still want to understand the outrage. 

Encryption is about basic privacy and ownership. Like locking the door to your house. It's not the enemy, and it's so easy to do that banning it is pointless. It doesn't require paid enterprise level software.

5437 :: Internet.org Is Not Neutral, Not Secure, and Not the Internet
I think a lot of people see the "giving Internet to people in poverty" thing and stop thinking. This would absolutely be an excellent thing for them in the very short term, but at medium to long term it's nothing but a powerful tool to keep them under the control of big business. Likely, also a tool to try and introduce the same thing elsewhere. This is just another battleground in the war against a general purpose network.

With greatest respect, this isn't an issue of net neutrality at all. Facebook isn't blocking anyone from using the net - and they're not an Internet service provider in the way the telcos are. They're subsidizing access to a few basic sites for people who might not be able to afford access to *any*. 

Labeling this effort "not neutral" is dragging our politics into an unrelated context; it's simply not the correct interpretive frame. It would be like saying: "People can't afford to drive, but we don't want to give people Vespa scooters, because that would unduly influence them and lead to too many Vespas on the road. So let's either buy everyone the car of their choosing (which is prohibitively expensive) or let them drive *nothing* instead."

This is an example of "letting the perfect be the enemy of the good". In other words, in arguing against Internet.org, it *sounds* like you're being righteous, but in reality you're  just being self-righteous; all this argument does is harm the people it's intended to help, in the name of helping them.

ITT: a ton of people that don't really understand/have never used the app. It doesn't block you from the rest of the internet, but it will let you know if your about to navigate away from one of the supported aps/sites that you will be charged at your usual rate for data.

The Philippines version is pretty nice. It supports FB, messenger, wattpad (some people enjoy that i guess), weather center, baby center, a map app (don't remember which one) and several other fairly unbiased, informative sites. FB is a lesser version, doesn't look like the app or the mobile site (kind of looks like the style sheet didn't load), but it has all the same functions.

If anyone's interested I can pop off some screen captures on her phone and load them if it will help people get a better grasp of what the app does and doesn't do. I see a lot of blind hatred on Reddit, but it's actually a nice app for a lot of people.

5436 :: Cupertino's mayor: Apple 'abuses us' by not paying taxes. Barry Chang...
One thing that seems lost on most of the commenters is that we're talking about local politics where taxes are raised by sales tax and property tax. Apple paid 9.2 million in taxes last year, which was 18% of the city's general fund. 

This would be unrelated to Apple's schemes to avoid US federal taxes.

The Mayor's stance seems to be, "Apple is making a lot of money, so they should give us more money," but missing from the article, or the Mayor's position, is in what ways, if any, Apple is avoiding paying taxes. If they are getting tax breaks on property taxes, those would be approved by the city counsel.

So who goes down to a corporate head office without an invitation expecting an impromptu meeting with executives?

Replace "Apple" with "any large company" and this still applies.

It has got to stop.

I understand his plight, but some of this is silly.   You can't just walk into the lobby of a huge company and be surprised when they escort you out, that would happen at my company.  And a random "please give us $100 million even though no law says you should" motion not passing isn't surprising either.

That said, obviously something needs to change, just maybe not in the ways the mayor is trying to do it.

5436 :: Cupertino's mayor: Apple 'abuses us' by not paying taxes. Barry Chang...
Cupertino is doing fine. Roads are fine. They're doing so much construction for the space ship that they have to dig up the roads to put in the needed infrastructure to support said spaceship, so in effect new roads. Is there more traffic? Sure. Mostly due to construction now. But all of SV has traffic.101 is always jammed. 85 is jammed and it passes right through Cupertino because it sits in between San Jose where a lot of folks live and Mountain View where Google is. FB is up off the 101. A bunch of the other SV tech companies reside off the 101. 

 People want to live in Cupertino and surrounding areas thus home prices get pushed up. Higher/dual income earners move in, local businesses do well as well. Is Sunnyvale complaining? The space ship borders that town. I'd bet the local residents are somewhat happy due to the trickle down effect yet they may not get all the same local taxes paid by Apple? I'm not sure how that works. Local shopping centers are all getting upgrades and lots of new construction going on. 

 Are schools infrastructure deteriorating? No. They seem to be the same as any other California school. In fact bc of the high income earners from the 70s-80s-90s that moved to Cupertino, it has some of the best public schools in the nation. Those same higher income families tend to help support the schools as much as they can. It's not like Apples tax money goes directly to the schools anyways. School infrastructure costs and such are all handled by  the state. 

I'm sure if Apple wanted to move most other cities would be glad to have them.

 I smell whining.

It's funny, Apple's just finishing up construction on their new headquarters, also located in Cupertino. The city can't really kick Apple out of their existing building, but the city does have to approve the zoning and construction of any new buildings. If the city hates Apple so much, why did they approve their new headquarters?
69
5436 :: Cupertino's mayor: Apple 'abuses us' by not paying taxes. Barry Chang...
I'm a Cupertino resident who has been directly affected by the construction of AC2, and this is BS 10 ways to Sunday.

Barry Chang does anything and everything Apple asks.  

It's true that they don't contribute to the tax base as much as they should, but that's because Barry and his cronies have given them tax breaks.

It's true that the roads are too crowded, but that's because Barry and his cronies approved their construction plans.

It's true that they cut down some beautiful old growth trees outside my house to make room for a new freeway offramp to allow their employees to get to work faster in the morning while turning the view from my office from "forrest like" to "urban wasteland".

And you know what, I don't blame Apple for any of this.  It's 100% the fault of the Mayor and his crew approving all this stuff.

5428 :: Netflix has blocked the use of VPNs in Spain and other European count...
At least they should then improve their content delivery system for smaller countries. For example, to watch Better Call Saul from Finland you have to wait for Finnish translations to be vendored by Netflix, even though I'd be perfectly fine to watch the show without any. So far I've just logged in through Amsterdam on release day, which seems to provide the Dutch translations immediately, letting me to just switch the subtitles to English instead of Dutch.

I think Netflix is overestimating the need of local subtitles especially in Northern Europe, where people are more or less fluent in English anyway. The use of VPN's might not be that much to get around exclusive content for some countries, but to instead fix something what seems like a bad design choice and lack of understanding of their own audience.

e: Looks like my VPN is blocked as well. Too bad none of the season 2 episodes yet have subtitles in Netflix.

5418 :: Woman who got 153 robocalls awarded nearly $230,000
Cross-post from the other thread on this topic:

Attorney here:

The law this woman sued under is the "Telephone Consumer Protection Act" (or TCPA for short). I do this kind of work for a living.

Simply put, the TCPA prohibits prerecorded or autodialed calls or texts to cellular telephones without consent (the type of consent needed depends on the type of call). Damages are $500-$1500 per call.

There are other prohibitions as well (related to the Do Not Call List, landlines, and junk faxes). See this [cheatsheet](http://i.imgur.com/8S2Z5rv.png) I very quickly put together. I also wrote a lengthy YSK (needs some updating) a few months back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2ywtop/ysk_your_rights_and_remedies_for_junk_faxes_and/). Not legal advice, etc etc.

It's important to keep in mind, however, that just because the calls are illegal does not mean there's always someone to be held accountable. Many of the calls come in from spoofed caller IDs, overseas, scammers, etc. My short hand in determining if a company is likely worth suing? The calling company 2 of the following: a website, a live phone number, or a Google search of the calling number links back to the caller. Not guaranteed worth it even if it has two of those; not guaranteed to be bad if it doesn't.

That explains also why calls continue even after the "Do Not Call" list. It's not that the list doesn't work, it's just that the companies who violate it often don't care that they're violating it because they're shady and hard to find.

I have a few cases under this law currently pending. One relates to those "free cruise" text messages. Another relates to 600 text messages received after my client wrote a letter asking the company to stop. Another is a company that  used "confirmation" text messages as a sneaky way to advertise by sticking an ad at the bottom of each text (likely millions of texts).

Some other items from a business perspective, for those interested: for an individual case, I usually prefer 20+ calls, but it depends on the facts. Otherwise, I usually bring these cases as a class action. My take is 1/3 (so in the event of a $229,500 award, I would receive $76,500). If we don't win, I don't get paid. My take in class cases would be a lower percentage (judges rarely approve anything close to 1/3 in a class settlement; 15-20% is more accurate).

5417 :: A fleet of trucks just drove themselves across Europe: About a dozen ...
I've ridden in an autonomous driven vehicle before: a John Deere combine.  My father-in-law rents his farmland to a local company that has invested in some very cool equipment.  He talked the company into letting myself and my young son ride along in the combine.  I think I was ten times more excited than my son once I realized I was driving in an autonomously driven vehicle! 

The operator had his hands nearby the steering wheel so he could take control if there was something they needed to dodge.

After explaining how well it worked and watching it for a bit I glanced over at the tractor that had pulled up along side us.  The combine was unloading the corn it was picking into the trailer the tractor was pulling while it was picking more corn.  It didn't take me long to realize the driver of the tractor was not in control of the tractor.  He had his feet up, the driver chair turned backwards, talking on his cell phone.  I asked the combine operator what was going on and he said that the combine was controlling the tractor as well.

Autonomous driving vehicles are here already.  They aren't starting out as cars, they are starting out as commercial vehicles!

I actually won against comcast due to cancelling. I asked them to write down on the notes of my account that I am cancelling and confirm it before they transferred me to whatever department to try to keep me. After they billed me for another 2 months, I asked them to repeat the notes and it was there and they had to give up the charges and notify all credit check companies that were docking me for the fees. it was glorious.

well, for a tool that needs 2-5 minutes to upload a single picture (when i still had a hope, it uploaded 300 pictures in 24 hours), i'd say, that's a ballsy move.

and if anybody has doubts: [here's how many threads exist only on flickr discussing its speeds](https://www.google.ch/search?q=flickr+uploadr+slow&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=qfLfVsC_IaLgyQOZ75S4Aw#q=flickr+uploadr+slow+site:www.flickr.com)

in the end i've uploaded my couple of thousands of pictures with a command line flickr_upload tool (with approx 300 images per hour speed, that's 25 times speed up), but i guess it's not a solution for everybody.

There is any real alternative to flikr which gives you both ownership and options to upload your photos?

This thread is filled with knee-jerk reactions from people that don't even use Flickr and are jumping to immediate, incorrect conclusions. You can still upload photos for free, just not automatically upload hundreds of photos at once. This does kill Flickr in its use as a photo-dump storage site, but not as a photo sharing site. This move does nothing to those who use Flickr socially. The free uploader is still much easier than that of Instagram, and Flickr will still remain as a more photography oriented Instagram

Best theory I can come up with is that they are trying to save their brand by avoiding the 'Instagram effect' of mass-produced, low quality photos.

A paywall may mean a smaller but more dedicated community of photographers and hobbyists rather than teens with iPhones. Then again, it could tank their business, so who knows.

The majority of the requests being for removal of personal information doesn't change the fact that it's an incredibly broad ruling that compromises the integrity of search engine results. It's also clearly a clumsy solution to target the "right to erasure" that everyone really cares about.

I note that because "private_personal_info" represents such a large majority of removal requests, it means people made over 77,000 inappropriate requests for removal of information at the 37% rejection rate.

Here's a short history of Internet advocacy for those of us who joined sometime after 1992 or so.

Netscape Communications Corp created SSL, for HTTPS, for secure shopping.  Phil Zimmerman made the "PGP" encryption tool, uh, a long time ago.  Up until that point, people at home never really used encryption, and the US had export laws that made it illegal to provide strong encryption to people in other countries, because as far as the government was concerned, encryption was very much a military thing that militarizes used.  They had no idea how or why citizens would use it.  Protecting your information on line was a brand new concept.  Before encryption was popular, there were people breaking types of security, such as Mitnick social engineering Motorola out of cellphone firmware because he was curious, and rooting Unix systems and collecting passwords, and stuff like that.  At first, mostly only big companies were on the 'net, after it opened up to stuff other than just academic institutions.  So, hackers were people who stole corporate secrets, as far as the government was concerned.

Steve Jackson Games, makers of CarWars, GURPS, Illuminati, and a bunch of other fantastic table top games and RPGs, created a Cyberpunk GURPs expansion.  The FBI got wind of it and raided their offices, confiscating basically everything, but not filing charges.  Basically just taking their stuff to punish them.  That was kind of a mistake because Steve Jackson Games had friends.  Lawyers got together and sued, and won, and got a promise that the FBI (or was it the CIA?) would never do anything like that again.

Steve Jackson Games immediately went on to make Hacker, loosely based on Illuminati, where players build a network with cards drawn each turn, and then try to take over the 'net, helping or interfering with each other as they go.

The government was still trying to throw everyone in jail who seemed like they might at all be a threat.  People who made network security tools (SATAN was one of the first ones) were prosecuted.  The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was used to throw anyone in jail who did anything "unauthorized" computer a computer.  People who worked in IT who told their bosses that their passwords were weak were thrown in jail for "hacking" (because obviously they were doing something bad and unauthorized if they knew their bosses passwords were weak).

The bleak political scene is part of what prompted the creation of the EFF by the people who defended Steve Jackson Games.  So, SJG was their first case, really.  They've sued and organized and advised on legal matters dealing with technology ever since.  Everyone here who has an income of their own should be a membership.  I think memberships start at something like $40/year for students.  Flying teams of lawyers around to (quite often successfully) sue the government takes money.

Not long after that, Netscape and PGP scared the government.  The US government was in the habit of keeping its global operations secret while trying to crack other nation's communications.  Laws were introduced that would require all encryption to use "the Clipper chip", a proposed design that works sort of TSA luggage locks, where the government knew how to crack it.

This wouldn't have worked, because academic and amateur cryptanalysis are too good.  It would have been widely installed, difficult to replace, and completely broken.  You'd have to have a physical piece of hardware.  Software encryption would have been illegal under that this law, including jailing people who wrote it.  EFF's position was that cryptography is just math, and you can't jail people for doing math.  This was narrowly defeated, thanks to lots of Internet advocacy.  It was kind of wild-west back then.  The attitude of "this is our space, you assholes have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, fuck off and leave us alone" was much stronger than it is now and was shared by entrepreneurs, academics, hackers, and hactivists alike.  Everyone was on the 'net for a reason; everyone was part of something; no one considered themselves "just a customer".  Just like Reddit has a community, places with strong sense of community have always existed on the 'net, but in the early days, there was also a sense of an Internet community, that defended the Internet.

If that had happened, it seems extremely unlikely that the e-commerce revolution would have happened.  At no point would people's data ever been safe.  We needed ssh and HTTPS to do that.  We also needed legal computer security research, and the EFF has non-stop defended researchers who frightened the government.  Again and again, some kid would come out with some security tool, and the government would try to lock them up.  Amazingly this still continues, even though computer security is now a respected industry, and it's well establish that good guys as well as bad guys work in these technologies.

TV news was running idiot scare stories that were extremely loosely based in reality in that they took jokes and ran with them as if they were epidemics, sort of like when everyone was felching and that was the new sex act that everyone couldn't get enough of.  News is a bit more savvy now days as pathetic as they are.

There were legal efforts rooted in copyright, too, that were successfully defended.  There was a "blue ribbon campaign" (when the web was a lot jankier, everyone had these on their sites... hmm, I should bring that back):  https://www.eff.org/pages/blue-ribbon-campaign

Laws were pushed and nearly passed that would make it illegal to link to something that links to something that has copyrighted material on it, making people responsible for the actions of other people, and making everyone responsible for checking the legal status of everything.

There was another law floated and defeated that would make ISPs liable for the actions of their users, so if you posted copyrighted material online, your ISP could get sued.  The obvious result of that would be that no site would be able to accept the legal exposure of hosting content for people unless there was money and legal contract involved between those two parties (ie, you're paying for hosting, and even then, to cover their liability, they'd have to charge a lot more).  This was back in the days where free hosting like anglefire.com were just appearing, and it was difficult and expensive to run your own server (had to stick a machine in colocation for $200/month or so, and Linux wasn't really stable or mature yet), and ISPs were just starting to offer web space for their customers.  So basically it was designed to turn the Web into cable TV, where people at home observed commercially produced content, but didn't produce content of their own, because the cost was too high and companies had to deal with liability.  That was defeated.  Sites like imgur that let people casually post things came much later.

tl;dr Stupid laws are never ending; the EFF is fucking awesome so get your membership today; the Internet is only still around right now because we defeated those; we need those who weren't there when this all started to stick with us in protecting this cesspool of awesomeness.  Thank you.

5385 :: Man builds house, then finds out cable Internet will cost $117,000. C...
I've been trying to build or buy a house for about a year now. The reach of broadband in my area is *abysmal*. Remember earlier this year when basically this exact same thing happened? [It should be required reading for any homebuyer](http://consumerist.com/2015/03/25/new-homeowner-has-to-sell-house-because-of-comcasts-incompetence-lack-of-competition/)  
  
So far, I've walked out on 2 houses where the seller promised broadband was available. Both times they put it in writing on the buy/sell agreement that it was available. Both times it was a lie and the owner was either using 4G or satellite internet. I've also had an agreement with a builder fall through because the best he could do was to say "Charter is planning to expand to this area next year". This is all within a mile or two of city limits. Some of these places are surrounded by million dollar homes, and yet... nothing.  
  
Realtors continue to act suprised when I tell them it's a deal-breaker if there's no broadband. Builders continue to put $400k+ homes up with no internet. Every time I go to look at a house, I'm checking for cable boxes in the neighborhood. I call neighbors to ask what their internet is. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

When I worked for a WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) that did terrestrial based internet (IE, not to space) I installed **at least** 20 houses that were built because the internet company said "Yeah! Totally!" then months later after stalling would say "We've never had service there, we would never say that", so they'd call my company out and we'd hook them up. 

People spent over $80,000+ and got fucked.

Two years ago, I was searching for a house in a rural area, internet service was top priority

The realtor only had a fuzzy idea idea what parts of town were served

I went to the Comcast office. They said that they had a coverage map in the back room..but I couldn't see it or get a copy

I had to give them a specific address, and they would look it up

Some local users had made a crowdsourced map, but they warned that it was inaccurate

In short..finding really accurate information was very hard

ATT did the same thing to my wife and I. Asked ATT if internet was avaialble where I was building.  They assured me it was, also my neighbors have internet from ATT.  Once we were ready for internet, ATT said it was capped.  Now I have a home, with 0 internet while also being a technician andI am unable to do work from home in case an emergency happens at work and I am not there. Which is why I needed the goddamned internet. Fuck ATT and the horse it rode in on.

I have a buddy who moved to upper NY state. He called the ISP up there twice to make sure he had coverage and they confirmed. Then he got on IM with them and triple checked and kept the conversation. Of course after he bought the home they tell him there is no service and it would be $38,000 for them to run a drop. Instead of telecommuting he travels daily now. 

EDIT: If it helps anyone I have required a bandwidth check as part of my closing on the last two houses I've bought. Meaning, I get a printout or screenshot from speedtest.net as PART OF MY CONTRACT. Both times the seller laughed but when I pointed out stories like this and the fact that I work from home they understood and provided it way in advance as I pretty much told them lousy (or no) Internet was a deal killer. You can put anything in a contract. :)

IF you need internet connection to do your job, make 100% sure you can get internet before making a permanent move.

Beyond just calling an ISP, because they will always say they can get you service, and speeds are "up to" 24Mbps. That doesn't mean they can deliver that 24Mbps.

5384 :: T-Mobile Is Flat Out Lying: It's Throttling Video Even Though It Says...
This is the clarification from T-Mobile:

> They confirmed that they don’t do any actual optimization of video streams other than reducing the bandwidth allocated to them (and relying on the provider to notice, and adapt the bitrate accordingly).

Reducing bandwidth for an application is known as throttling. And, as Dualsim and EFF have shown, that's true even for video providers not enrolled in T-Mobile's zero rating program.

I must have misread the notifications I got a few weeks (months?) back when they started texting me about Binge On. I thought they were introducing a new free service you could turn on, not that it was automatically enabled. The past few weeks I noticed YouTube loading videos significantly slower in HD but would buffer almost instantly when I lowered quality when on 4g with full signal whereas before HD videos were loading almost as fast as my 50mbps connection on my home computer. Tmobile was doing so good with all the changes they've been making then they try to sneak this shit by...it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.
35
5384 :: T-Mobile Is Flat Out Lying: It's Throttling Video Even Though It Says...
I actually got attacked and had to pretty much describe just this, that t-mobile only had two ways to "optimize" playback quality, which was to either change your packets to show 480 quality as a selected option, or to throttle, there was no other options available. Good thing these came out just a few days later to vindicate me ;P

5384 :: T-Mobile Is Flat Out Lying: It's Throttling Video Even Though It Says...
Dealing with them right now about connection and speed issues is so annoying.  I recently spoke with a rep and explained that I had been reluctant to spring for 4G because I could barely notice a difference after my monthly limit was reached.  The rep wasn't much help, kinda blamed my bad connection on location.  My connection passes speed tests but I can't stream video, and even Spotify is, well, spotty.  I'm already receiving free 4G thru February, but the rep was too busy trying to convince me that my connection was slow because I needed to upgrade the data.  Yeah, let me just give you $30 a month for a service that doesn't seem to work for me.

18
5384 :: T-Mobile Is Flat Out Lying: It's Throttling Video Even Though It Says...
I noticed actual throttling as well.

Speedtest's to multiple servers returned 40+ mbps downstream, but trying to load a 720p or 1080p with Binge On turned on would constantly buffer and make the video unwatchable.

For those wondering why 480p or an actual throttled youtube video is unacceptable on a phone screen: Try and watch a screenshot video or a youtube video that is fairly dark... The resolution isn't there is almost useless.

I turned Binge On off and its back to streaming without a hitch.

this is the same tactic that redflex used with the redlight cameras...

they pitch the idea to municipalities as pure revenue generation, they fly in PR experts to frame the implementation to the locals as "for public safety" (won't someone please think of the children), or more recently "cause terrorism". the public looks the other way with the "i've got nothing to hide" mentality, allowing the government to abuse it's citizenry based on the PR firms propaganda...

it takes years and years for these systems to be challenged in court, for them to be thrown out, but by the time the rights of the people catch up to the technology it's to late... the damage has been done.

the company makes the money, the cities have made the money, and the citizens are left poorer with fewer freedoms.

it's a real shame, but this is the next wave of bullshit that all major cities are going to employ.

along with these "free" plate readers comes the DMV forcing people to have front and back plates (which costs you more money), and the cities increasing the fines for violations.

most people will remember when the redlight cameras first showed up in their cities it was only supposed to be catching redlight runners, and they would only deploy them at the "10 most dangerous intersections, and they would **never** be used as speed cameras (for safety).

but fast forward a few years later and these cameras are at 100 intersections, they are being used for speed enforcement, and the fines have shot through the roof.

the same abuse will happen with these plate cams... they will find a way to abuse them and they will slowly turn the thumb screws until they find the limit they can push the populace.

Government should be there to protect and serve the people to make sure everybody is playing on even ground. The government should also uphold its own values and punish those that cheat the system and/or harm others.

5386 :: Edward Snowden: ‘Governments can reduce our dignity to that of tagged...
Here is the sad truth about sovereign governments: The power they wield took its form under totalitarian rulers who generally had the ethical outlook of characters on Game of Thrones -- and not the nice ones either. 

The American Revolution and the other revolutions it sparked improved the situation. However, it took the same brutal, absolutist power as had existed since medieval and ancient times and tried to wield it "for the people, by the people." The power governments wield is the same totalitarian power that chiefs and kings once held, it's just that we are told we have "rights" though they are granted more like privileges. (Which is how and why governments sometimes take them away, as noted by people like Snowden.) Such power should not exist in this strange and harsh form at all. However, we hold onto these forms out of inertia and out of fear of fellow human beings outside the borders.  

Have you ever wondered why government and military organizations can be so brutal? It's because they were born of a brutal ethos in a brutal time. They are literally ancient, eldritch non-physical entities whose moral outlook is foreign and inhumane. The modern democracies are basically like Hellboy. They are as powerful and inhuman as Chthulu, but somehow they have been raised to be well meaning and at times try hard to do good. (And at times, you see their frightening heritage show.) 

(EDIT: But please don't confuse me with nutjobs who use the concept of sovereignty to justify being an asshat. Every idea that's before its time has those, unfortunately.)

The problem is eventually they may give in and add an off switch, but then there will be an announcement and it will be a thing. If they just put it in there to begin with, people wouldn't have gone looking for it unless they were poking around or tech minded. now it will be a media event and more people will click it than would have if it was part of the OS on day one. They shot themselves in the foot with this one.

"By default Windows 10 Home is allowed to control your bandwidth usage, install any software it wants whenever it wants (without providing detailed information on what these updates do), display ads in the Start Menu (currently it has been limited to app advertisements), send your hardware details and any changes you make to Microsoft and even log your browser history and keystrokes which the Windows End User Licence Agreement (EULA) states you allow Microsoft to use for analysis."

"We're collecting telemetry off of your system and you don't get a choice of whether you like that or not. Also, it's none of your fucking business what we do with that."

Seriously, who the fuck do they think they are?

5382 :: Microsoft needs to fit Windows 10 with a data collection 'off switch'
I remember sitting through a presentation from MS where they showed what they use their telemetry data on. It was a short thing about how they were able to detect some kind of issue that was draining batteries on a certain model laptop. Using the data they were able to issue a patch that increased battery life and performance on that particular model. It was pretty cool stuff.

Is that the data we're talking about here? An off switch seems like a good idea in general but at the same time that's a pretty good use case.
123
5382 :: Microsoft needs to fit Windows 10 with a data collection 'off switch'
>Well, that's not entirely true, because Windows 10 Enterprise users can disable all data -- including telemetry data -- from being sent back to Microsoft. 

Actually, no... you can not. Even the enterprise versions still phone home. No one... except MS, knows what data is being sent.

Multiple experts (and others) have vetted and verified this. The info is all over the web.

People set up experiments with Win10 machines and monitored their activity over time, and showed without a doubt, that even after having jumped multiple technological hoops (backing off on updates, making reg edits, etc..)... being savvy, they were NOT able to fully disable the operating system's ability to send 'something' back to home base.

5382 :: Microsoft needs to fit Windows 10 with a data collection 'off switch'
When I first read about Windows 10 and this recording shit being hard to impossible to disasble I thought, I'll just avoid Win 10 as much I can.

Then, when I read that these elements are being wrapped back into Windows 7 and 8.x as "recommended" updates, I had enough. Naturally this is going to be applied to anyone trying to get all the updates.

So what did I do?

I switched to Ubuntu. I play all the games I want (League of Legends, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, CS:GO, DotA2, Alien: Isolation, and so much more).

It runs faster, I have full control over the environment, oh and the updates are way faster.

What's your excuse? It's hard? Yeah right, easiest fucking OS of my life. I don't even have to go looking for drivers.

www.ubuntu.com come join me, let's have fun, together :)

I'll gladly help anyone with any questions or any problems they may have.

States are clearly confused by the varied usage of the word "language."
210
5376 :: States consider allowing kids to learn coding instead of foreign lang...
The programming languages they're proposing are C++, Python and Javascript. Good, but I just think about [Linus Torvald's C++ rant](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918).
73
5376 :: States consider allowing kids to learn coding instead of foreign lang...
I don't think this makes any sense at all. What I gained the most from my foreign language studies in (US) school was a much deeper and thorough understanding of my primary language.  A programming language is NOT the same as a human language.

One of these is used to communicate with people, and they other is used to direct a machine. The tasks are really entirely different.

Consider: translate this sentence into C++, and then back again without an a priori understanding of the original sentence.  

Edit:
It seems people think I'm against adding computer science to our general curriculum. Far from it, I think it's a fantastic idea.  But I don't think that learning a programming language should satisfy a foreign language requirement.  Plenty of commenters have already given reasons that I agree with, so I won't bother to mention those here.

Further, I don't want to suggest the current US curriculum is deficient in English. I wasn't taught the current curriculum, and I'm not familiar with it.

Two things I don't understand about ISP pricing.

1. How come these schemes that go up and down depending on how much and to whom you complain don't caught as advertisement fraud? Likewise with the bundles. Is there a knowledge gap with judges and prosecutors that they don't understand it's just all "bits" when it comes to IPTV and YouTube?
2. How do these price by neighborhood/address don't run afoul of the redlining statutes? I guess those might be for insurance and infrastructure but still. The same thing is happening. Where you live is determining how much you pay and what you get. In a just society that's not how it should work.

It's a pretty ludicrous idea that people would blame Snowden, as we've been told for years before him that terrorists use encryption and stay off phones and email. Not to mention...

> One key premise here seems to be that prior to the Snowden reporting, The Terrorists helpfully and stupidly used telephones and unencrypted emails to plot, so Western governments were able to track their plotting and disrupt at least large-scale attacks. That would come as a massive surprise to the victims of the attacks of 2002 in Bali, 2004 in Madrid, 2005 in London, 2008 in Mumbai, and April 2013 at the Boston Marathon. How did the multiple perpetrators of those well-coordinated attacks — all of which were carried out prior to Snowden’s June 2013 revelations — hide their communications from detection?

So they blocked a social media multi level marketing scam (pyramid scheme)? Good for them. 

The only model that wouldn't be a scam would be if I and only I was paid like an artist on iTunes or a personality on YouTube, a small percentage of money based on views/engagement, and the majority goes to the company because they host my content and work with companies to host advertisements. The whole "parent" and "child" thing Tsu tries to sell you on is just one of the many ways you describe a pyramid scheme.

"Apple may have power and might, and more of the **public** on its side than any party in politics ever will, but **the government** has the power to bring that all crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions."

Um, the government is supposed to be, by the people, for the people, and of the people. Not the government and then also the people.

Apple should pass the fines onto its consumers and call it the "NSA dick pics tax" on its receipts.  Companies need to get creative in showing that they care for us.
803
5326 :: Apple, in refusing backdoor access to data, may face fines
My problem with this is technological, and it's an almost invisible slippery slope that the UK has already gone down...

Apple isn't refusing give the US government data that it has. What they're saying is that they don't have the data. The data the Government wants is encrypted on one phone, sent through Apple's servers and decrypted on the target phone. Apple has no more access to this data than a malicious third party.

What the government is saying is that creating a truly secure communications mechanism is, in effect, illegal. *This is very dangerous*. It makes US-developed technology immediately second-rate and puts our major technology industries in a very difficult position in the global market.

For example, Samsung could claim that they can no longer trust Google to make their OS, fork Android and re-implement their own social stack (gmail, hangouts, etc.) and the public might actually rally behind that.

The US government is effectively destroying the currency of freedom in the global marketplace. Bravo.

> The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device

How will they get this public key? Can you generate a new public key without the access to the private key? If so, isn't the whole system broken?
89
5326 :: Apple, in refusing backdoor access to data, may face fines
Shut your doors, Apple.

Send everyone on vacation, and stop all development, manufacturing, and support. Close every Apple Store, and shut down every manufacturing plant. Issue a statement that you'd rather see Apple vanish than capitulate to government bullies.

They can't *make* you work, but I'm sure you won't be on vacation long when a billion consumers start demanding that the government back off.

Make history once again. Don't compromise, don't negotiate, don't back down or capitulate. Tell the government **no**, and don't lift a finger until they leave you alone.

*EDIT 1: RIP, inbox, Saturday.*

*EDIT 2: Thank you, kind stranger for the Gold.*

*EDIT 3: Yes, I'm aware there's a bit of hyperbole in the explanation above, but the general sensibility that Apple should make a BIG HAIRY DEAL out of being PUNISHED for REFUSING TO COMPLY with the government's demand that they cripple their security features remains. I realize they have shareholders to satisfy, but I DON'T think a general strike - if handled with principle and courage - would, in the long term, cause Apple's demise. Even if it did, it would be far better to see them crushed into nonexistence than to be broken and made a tool for government. Apple needs to fight this HARD.*

684
5331 :: Websites, Please Stop Blocking Password Managers. It’s 2015
A more pressing problem:

Stop limiting the maximum length or choking on spaces. You're supposed to be hashing the fucking things; if your application chokes on spaces or more than 20-24 characters then you're an idiot who shouldn't be anywhere near software development.

Also STOP WITH THE FUCKING SECURITY QUESTIONS. It's a feature literally designed to make it harder to legitimately recover an account while making it easier to steal your identity.

>It's important to point out that LastPass itself was hacked earlier in the year.

Which further proves the point.  Even WITH that breach, virtually nothing was gained by the hackers.  LastPass (and it's competitors) don't store your password; they store encrypted versions of it that only you can access via key.  And since they give you a scrambled unique password on every site (if you use their generation function) it further insulates their databases from being useful to breaches.

That's the whole point of password managers.  It's not that LastPass will never get hacked or breached.  It's that they understand how to make sure breached data is not useful for those instances where it happens.  They do all the stuff right that the average website doesn't.

58
5331 :: Websites, Please Stop Blocking Password Managers. It’s 2015
Website designers have to purposefully add code to prevent browsers from storing these passwords, and only a small minority of sites do this. The specific bit of code looks like this:

    autocomplete=off

You'll find it in the html tag associated with the login form. So, all you have to do to get your browser to save your password is to remove this little bit of code from the webpage. If you're using firefox, the firebug addon allows you to edit code on the fly and it is easy to remove. There are also dedicated addons that automate the job to make it even easier, you can probably find them for your browser of choice.

5308 :: Local Library will start lending mobile hotspots soon - with unlimite...
US library IT Manager here. This is a great and ambitious idea, but it's not all upside. We're considering purchasing mobile hotspots to lend out, and the feedback we've heard from other libraries already doing so is that the wait lists for the devices are massive. Our tech budget is already stretched thin, so we would need grants just to get the program off the ground. Buying more to cut down on wait list times is sadly not a likely option. We're all about opening up technology and internet access to all our patrons, but I can't help but feel like this initiative is more or less throwing starfish back into the ocean.

Even still, it's substantially better than nothing. Our school districts adopted 1-to-1 programs last year, so every public student in grades K-12 has an iPad, laptop, or Chromebook. 30% of them don't have internet at home and have to go to fast food restaurants or come to the library (or sit in our parking lot after hours) to submit homework. The tech is a kiss/curse for them. 

I'm ecstatic that libraries are the one's trying to fill the digital access gap, but I'm really looking forward to the day that broadband internet becomes a utility that everyone has access to.

FINAL EDIT
-----
I SEE THE LIGHT. While I think what T-mobile is doing is great, it's because I trust them to not screw me. If all the other ISPs did it it would be bad. It's easiest to say all traffic is the same with no caveats rather then only letting cars with approved paint colors take the left lane and pass everyone.

---------


I have one question about the T-mobile binge on. Aren't they opening the program to anyone who meets their specs? Doesn't that mean even startups and small businesses can use it? Or are the requirements to hard for small companies to afford to meet?

I can see if they were opening up their program only to netflix but if any company can join why is this an issue of free internet? Just because they are keeping a data cap? Or lowering my speed if I go over?


EDITED---------


Finally! Thanks to /u/wayward_wanderer we have the specs. Can someone read them and make them smaller words so my sheep brain can understand?

Actually, T-Mobile is one of the biggest supporters of net neutrality in the telecom industry.  The whole binge-on program is a technical specification that if ANY video stream provider can meet, their customers using the service are not charged for the bandwidth that is used while using the service.  The specification is also an open standard.  How is that breaking the internet? 
58

ITT: People who realize they aren't actually for net neutrality if it means they can get something they like for free now.
89
5309 :: Are Comcast and T-Mobile ruining the Internet? We must endeavor to pr...
Cyber guy here. On land we have zero bandwidth issues. So ISPs like Comcast are bad because they are putting a cap on data. Carriers have a challenge. How do we provide a service that doesn't hurt bandwidth on our towers? T-Mobile can allow anyone to participate in the program if they follow easy specs. They don't want legal on their back for illegal content. That's good. 480 is alright because it doesn't hurt bandwidth in the end. So coverage and service will be great. This pushes other providers to change or they lose customers. 
19
5309 :: Are Comcast and T-Mobile ruining the Internet? We must endeavor to pr...
Previously, cell providers have successfully argued that caps are necessary to help regulate the limited bandwidth available to cell sites. 

With binge on, T-Mo is saying, actually unlimited is fine as long as individual bandwidth consumption stays below a certain level.

If they have the ability to serve unlimited data within the bandwidth limitations imposed by "Binge On" then why don't they make those constraints and unlimited bandwidth universal? 

I see only two options:
Pro consumer option: This is a carefully controlled test case, preceeding a wider rollout at a later date. 

Anti-consumer option: This is establishing an ostensibly consumer friendly walled garden, to which they can later charge admission.

I hope, but doubt, that it is the former.
16
5309 :: Are Comcast and T-Mobile ruining the Internet? We must endeavor to pr...
Simple answer for the capitalist market is, yes. A more educated answer is going to be a mix of yes and no. 

while these companies are able to provide services to many people in a way that minimizes redundancy (through the interaction of multiple companies), the lack of competition geographically allows these companies to unfortunately get away with a lot of problem areas.

Customer service is one of the newer components of "new generation" businesses. Quite frankly, in previous years, early marketing strategies suggested that the only thing needed to be successful was to push out the most product. Or maybe for a provider of a service it could be memberships.

However, in more monopolostic companies, they don't have to worry as much about market forces shifting their strategies. Comcast and t-mobile rely on memberships, only its the value of the content they provide that is dropping for people. They don't have to worry too much about membership switching because most people don't have better options (due to the monopolistic nature of their geographies).

So if we make things competitive again, will that fix everything? Well, sort of. In a more competitive market, the products and service usually increase in quality as market forces will shift the pricing to reflect value more accurately. I believe this will solve most of America's concerns about internet currently. by having it more competitive, we will open ourselves up to having higher speed, lower latency, and lower costing internet, while maintaining great customer service (and perhaps easy ways to cancel out of contracts.)

Brilliant machines that had domain style logins with permissions and home folders before this was a common thing. They also had a brilliant Basic with full logic statements (when, while, etc) and even inline assembly assembly.

The machine design was funded by the British Government under the BBC (yes, the TV station). The Basic was designed by university students and put Microsoft's Basic (by far the most common) to shame.

They were made by Acorn where is where the RISC chips that dominate mobile phones have their roots. All in all a very worthwhile affair as Governments have the fiscal base to do these things (though sadly do not do enough) with different goals then what drives private companies.

I had great fun as a young teen writing a Boulder Dash clone on one of these things but then that wasn't that unusual. Everyone interested in computers could program back then in the days before everyone became content consumers.

There is a massive misconception that authoritarian governments are effective at cracking down on domestic enemies, when in fact they're brutal *and* incompetent, punishing fucktons of innocent people along with some of those they are actually targeting. 

They aren't even effective at that for which they are most notorious:  unjustly persecuting the opposition.

5272 :: "Secrecy breeds incompetence because where there is failure, failure ...
This is especially true in the IT world.

Failure to comply with standards is kept secret, so it becomes standard practice not to comply. When 'fake it until you make it' becomes SOP, all pretense of actually investing resources to get things resolved properly are thrown out the window.

Then a few years later, when systems begin to crumble under the weight of business need and obsolete infrastructure, the asshole who cut corners has moved on (or up) and the ripple effect of that original incompetence becomes business halting tidal waves of long overdue maintenance.

Of course, I favor IT because I work there. But look at the country in numerous other respects. The war on drugs, California's droughts, bridges literally falling apart... These are not new problems. These are indicative of decades of incompetence, compounded with poor planning, that only begin to breach public awareness once the mess has become too widespread to conceal any longer.

The US government isn't new to keeping secrets. It's just become so complacent in working in the dark, that they're tripping over their own incompetence. Every leak was the byproduct of incompetence and arrogance in believing their secrets were safe, and they were very clearly not.

If Mass Surveillance was so staggeringly important, than how did we get wind of it? Makes you wonder what information that only two or three people in the world have access to. You know, actual closely guarded secrets.

> You will probably be unsurprised to hear that there was actually a lot of ink still available: in a 700ml cartridge, there was generally between 100 and 150 millilitres of ink still in the bag; about 14-21 percent. In smaller, 350ml cartridges, between 60 and 80ml of ink remained, or about 17-22 percent.

Brother does this shit too. I have a big brother multi-fuction color laser printer, and found out the hard way. There is actually a TIMER ont he toner, that eventually makes the printer stop printing all together REGARDLESS of the current ink levels. I have high-capacity toner in the machine and very rarely use it, so ive had the same toner for about 5-6 years. A few years in, the printer suddenly stopped working and gave me "out of toner" messages. I shook the toner and found it was still very full, and all prints I had done previously looked just fine (no fading or other signs of toner wearing out). I did some research online and found there are actual little time-released stickers on the troner that changes color over time, and little sensors that can tell the color of the stickers. Once the sticker reaches a certain color the printer stops working completely, forcing you to spend 500+ dollars on new toner.

I did some googling and found out I could put black electric tape over the sensors, and use a secret command on the numpad of the machine to reset the counter to continue printing. The fact that companies are legally allowed to LIE to their customers with hoprribly disgusting business practices like this just blows my mind

I had a Canon printer that would tell me it was low on ink after a few hundred pages. I discovered that hitting the "ok" button made the printer print anyway. It printed hundreds and hundreds more pages. I would guess the low ink warnings started when the ink had more than 50% life left. 

Finally that printer died. It was $100+ to fix it or $58 to get the new version. The new version doesn't have an "ok" button.

In my work we noticed the toner wasnt lasting very long. Even when we closed for Christmas for a week and didn't use the printer at all. So we starting just marking the calendar every time we changed the toner. It was exactly 50 days every time. Without fail.

If an epson ink cartridge goes completely empty, then air bubbles will get into the printhead. Once this happens, chances are your printer will be as good as toast. They try to estimate how much ink has been used but that number really isn't that accurate, which is why you end up with some left. Most printers that have non disposable printheads are designed this way.

Epson is now realeasing their own [continuous ink system on one of their printers](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/08/epson-ecotank-printers-deliver-cheap-ink/index.htm). I believe the price is $400 but you can by the ink in bulk.

It's not just a matter of the battery going bad eventually. I used to purchase an extra battery or two when I bought my device. Then when I ran out on the road, I could just pop another one in. No need to camp by an outlet or to charge it with an external battery device.

5263 :: The director of the NSA Admiral Michael Rogers just admitted at a Sen...
I like my privacy and dislike the NSA as much as the next guy, but I also like truthful and accurate headlines which this is not. The relevant parts of the article are as follows.

The question posed at the hearing was:

> As a general matter, is it correct that anytime there are copies of an encryption key — and they exist in multiple places — that also creates more opportunities for malicious actors or foreign hackers to get access to the keys?

and the response was:

> Again, it depends on the circumstances, but if you want to paint it very broadly like that for a yes and no, then i would probably say yes.

So to be clear, the director of the NSA is acknowledging that with each additional copy of an encryption key in existence, the probability that one of those is compromised goes up. That's not a revalation, that's just common sense. I would have been considerably more concerned if his answer had been that he did not believe that was the case. The debate here isn't over whether the risk is increased, the debate is over whether the benefits outweigh the risk, and since this question was only answered in a very broad, very general sense, it does not speak to that. If someone can point to one or more specific cases where government possession of encryption keys lead directly to a breach (and that has probably happened on many occasions, I'm not saying it hasn't) then that is significant, but that's not what the question or the answer were about and it's disingenuous of this headline to imply otherwise.

Quite the majority of (secured) services use [public key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which allows secure data transfer over an unsecured medium.

Unless whatever service you're using is sending out private keys, this changes nothing. Governments and ISPs have monitored your usage for a while anyways, this is no news. What _is_ serious is when software or various services provide backdoors for law enforcement to access your data or your computer.

5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
Must be a powerful feeling to have such control of one of the greatest inventions and sources of power ever created.  
485
5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
What I took away from the articles about this is that every Comcast customer should call and ask about Netflix and Net Neutrality. Overwhelm the "Customer Security Assurance Team" and make them want to burn the building down. Also be sure to call on an 800 number so they can pay for keeping you on hold about this.

It's good to see that Comcast is still being regressive. Their broadband plans look more like mobile data plans.

5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
I would actually be more interested in what one of the reps from this so-called "Customer Security Assurance Team" says when you actually ask them about Netflix, Net Neutrality, etc.

I was on the phone with Comcast today (called me to sign into a promotion, yada yada) and we started talking about these data caps. Told them how I've blown through over 100 GB in the past 10 days just watching Netflix and working from home.

Anyway, [am I the only one showing 250 GB as the cap now instead of 300 GB?](http://i.imgur.com/DGj7iXV.png) Granted, it isn't in effect for my area... yet.

Kill this while you still have the chance. If this is allowed, the shareholders of other ISPs will force every other ISP to do the exact same.

5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
“This is not a cap. We do not limit a customer’s use of the internet in any way at or above 300 GB”

Except for that whole charging you extra bit.
590
5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
If you think 300GB is plenty and that this doesn't affect you, it does.  This is all in preparation for 4k streaming services (and beyond).  In a few years, 4k will be the standard like 1080 is today.

It's not a technical limitation.  It's a way to keep charging you more and selling cable services, nothing more.
282
5251 :: How Comcast deals with customers who ask about Netflix or net neutrality
I don't have Comcast I have suddenlink in Northern California . The only competition in my area is ATT uverse. Both have a 250gb data cap. What can I do to help fight data caps? I was never even told about it I just hit it for the first time last September and thatS how I learned of it. I filed a complaint with the FCC i got a response from suddenlinkthat it was for congestion but now I really know,it's not. 

What can/should I do now?  They are also charging me double what they charge new people for service. Should I call and say I'm switching to att?'I wouldn't it's worse service but would that get the retention people to lower my prices?
They actually made it very hard for me to find out new customers pay half of what I do.

It's not only CD, it's all format shifts. It means that not only you're not supposed to rip CDs to play on your iPod (what iTunes does when you put a music CD in your PC is now illegal), but also if you buy ie. on ~~Bandcamp~~ some download service an album in FLAC, you can't convert it to MP3 to put it on your portable music player. You're actually supposed to buy it again. Wow. And if you need it in 192kbps MP3 instead of 320 because you're out of space, buy it again. That's more fucked up than you probably initially thought.

*EDIT* As pointed out, Bandcamp is a bad example, as they allow format change. But the point still stands for any content provider that doesn't allow that.

I have a collection of CDs, and I still occasionally get one from a band I really like, even though I've mostly moved to digital media. 

However, I'm not going to buy an album twice just because someone says I can't copy the CD to my computer so I can listen to it on my iPod with the rest of my music. Good luck enforcing that.

The EU is trying to put taxes on CD-R, DVD-R, hard drives, usb sticks and other storage media and give that money to the music industry as those mediums are enabling copyright violation. Many EU countries already do this. Many people don't use these mediums especially hard drives and usb sticks for this but we brits will likely have to pay more for these devices in the future for this though :(

I seriously hope companies stop going with touch controls inside of vehicles. The point of tactile controls is so you don't have to look at the screen to use them. And when you're bumping around in a car, you use touch for reference points and press down to gain control and steady your hand. If you try to do this in a touch screen, you just activate a bunch of buttons you didn't want to. 

Then again, I'm sure people who grew up with touch screens are just fine with it. I'll be the grumpy old man saying "back in my day..."

The exact issue came up in the Tim Cook 60 Minutes interview.

Tim Cook made the completely obvious point that America has totally demolished the trade education system.  You either go to 4-year college and become a white collar worker or you get mocked and derided and threatened with being stuck in a McJob your whole life.

The end result is a surplus of white collar workers who are great at designing things... but can't build shit.  Building things is a trade.  It requires hands-on experience, mentorship, specialized training.  Not quite blue collar but not sitting behind a desk all day.  Lots of certifications and few, if any, degrees.

Even if he wanted to hire a couple thousand fabricators and assemblers to build something in America, there aren't that many to hire.  I suspect that Apple pretty much hired everything they could to even build the MacPro plant.

But you know who has 1000s of well-trained tool and die machinists ready to go to work?  China and Taiwan.

5226 :: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism: "The game is no longer about ...
Can confirm. Work for an online ad agency with several of the country’s largest retailers as clients. Advertising revenue have shifted significantly in the last 5 years. Running banner ads on your site is no longer the cash cow it used to be, now it’s tracking your customers shopping habits (albeit anonymously) and selling the information for other brands to leverage. You’d be amazed how granular the data can get.

Edit: I wanted to shed a little more insight into a topic I can actually speak to, even if it’s realtively high level…

First, this practice is nothing new. It’s just what common advertising tactics have evolved into as we mover further and further into the information age. Advertisers have been buying demographic data as a means to target consumers since the advent of junk mail. Even today, custom mailing lists are generated and sold based on a number of variables (household income,  credit rating, family size, geographic location, etc). This data is collected in a number of ways, sometimes simply by combing through public records. 

Now we move to the dawn of the UPC. Walmart is in large part the behemoth it is today because it embraced the potential of data tracking through scanning UPCs at the register. Every product scanned was tracked, every purchase analyzed. From a high enough level, behavioral patterns will inevitably emerge. All those seemingly unrelated items sitting in the middle of aisles, in random locations throughout the store are anything but. Everything is strategically placed based on observed customer behavior. At this point, barring any personal association to a purchase via a credit card, this information is largely anonymous. And in reality, you personally don’t matter in this equation. You’re just a statistic in a sea of consumer data.

Enter the rewards program. Now brick and mortar stores, before e-commerce became king, could tie you *personally* to your shopping behavior. That data could then be analyzed internally and sold to third parties. You, in turn, receive personalized and/or exclusive savings for volunteering said data. Check out the small print, especially the privacy policy, next time someone asks you to sign up for their rewards program. Now we’re beginning to see consumer behavior become a viable revenue stream for retailers.

The internet grows and stores are born online, while existing brick and mortars see more and more of their sales shift to online shopping. Tracking users and their paths to purchase in the digital sphere now introduces a cornucopia of data to analyze that was previously unavailable. As e-commerce got its start most of this data was used to simply optimize the retailers’ online presence - learn more about their customer base for their own self-interest.

Online advertising continues to grow and some retailers look to cash in on their site traffic by serving banner ads. Makes sense, this is how everyone else is making money with advertising online. And more revenue streams is always a good thing. But for retailers this is a double edged sword - banners drive away traffic from your site, and may lead to purchases through other avenues. To keep ad revenue higher than potential sales losses, you need more ads. And you need to setup restrictions to keep conflicts of interest at bay, along with teams to monitor and enforce these rules. You can see how this snowballs into a veritable cluster. But there’s money to be made, with an entire industry of people telling you it’s a good idea. To this day there are opposing camps internal to every retailer who opens up their stores to external advertising. 

Online retailers are now everywhere, and competition is getting fierce. Stores now have to start looking inward again and focus on their bottom line - driving their own sales. Plus, internet users are getting savvy, now there’s all these annoying ad blockers whittling away ad impressions. Banner ads are no longer the golden goose they used to be. But wait, what if there was away to make money on ad sales *outside* of the store? 

If Google has proven one thing, it’s the power of the algorithm. With tremendous amounts of data and the right formulas, patterns of behavior inevitably surface. Enough data and enough patterns, and soon you’re odds of predicting future events gets exponentially better. We’ve seen it in several facets of life, from predicting the weather, to the likelihood of a baby boomer purchasing a luxury sedan. So now more and more retailers online are developing proprietary applications to gather and analyze as much information about their customers shopping behaviors as they can, and sell the service to advertisers to serve targeted ads outside their store. To retailers this is a huge win. Ad revenue without the hassle of dealing with banner ads vying for your customers attention while they’re shopping your site. Within the industry this is know as **Audience Extension**. Retailers are literally treating their customers (or audience) as a commodity. The level of granularity and the sheer amount of data you can provide is what gives you a competitive edge. For this reason, I’lll refrain from getting into any specifics as to what is being obtained. I primarily work on the creative side of advertising, not the technical, so I don’t have all of those specifics anyway. A majority of the data I see is all relational and demographic based. A theoretical example: fashion conscious millennials are 25% more likely to buy a hybrid.

Now, as I mentioned before, this is largely anonymous. You are just a set of correlated demographic data that gets lumped into a huge analytical engine, connecting the dots to an unimaginable number of patterns and relationships. Can this be used to manipulate you as an individual? Absolutely. Advertising at its core is just manipulation. Trying to coerce some kind of emotional connection between you and some brand or product. And remember, all of these relationships and patterns are found by observing, you, the consumer. They’re not contrived from thin air. Like it or not, human beings are very predicatable, habitual creatures.

TL;DR - The article is a little darker than need be IMO. What they are labeling as *consumer surveillance* is a logical evolution in existing advertising practices as we move further and further into the information age. The end result being advertising that is more relevant to the user and a better ROI for the advertiser. If this troubles you, then you as a consumer need to remain vigilant. Every time you browse an online store, create a personalized account, sign up for a rewards program, or let your insurance company track your driving to save a few bucks, you are volunteering your personal behaviors and preferences to be thrown into the data pool to some degree. And no one is collecting data just for the hell of it. Data = money.


Edit 2: Thank you to whoever gave me my first gold!

I'm always shocked when I see online ads and commercials on shows. I haven't had cable for years. All my stuff is set up to block ads. In the last year or so I've started running into websites that say no turn off ad blocking = no viewing our content. It used to be just Hulu that pulled that nonsense as far as I could tell. So far I've always been able to find the same content elsewhere without the paywall. If it gets to a point I can't do that, I don't know. I'm old and not cool, so I may just decide if I can't see it without ads, I don't need it. It seems to me likely the only way to win is not to play.

Another important paragraph:

> We’ve entered virgin territory here. The assault on behavioral data is so sweeping that it can no longer be circumscribed by the concept of privacy and its contests.  This is a different kind of challenge now, one that threatens the existential and political canon of the modern liberal order defined by principles of self-determination that have been centuries, even millennia, in the making. I am thinking of matters that include, but are not limited to, the sanctity of the individual and the ideals of social equality; the development of identity, autonomy, and moral reasoning; the integrity of contract, the freedom that accrues to the making and fulfilling of promises; norms and rules of collective agreement; the functions of market democracy; the political integrity of societies; and the future of democratic sovereignty.  In the fullness of time, we will look back on the establishment in Europe of the “Right to be Forgotten” and the EU’s more recent invalidation of the Safe Harbor doctrine as early milestones in a gradual reckoning with the true dimensions of this challenge.

1945
5223 :: Uber and Lyft pull out of Austin after locals vote against self-regul...
I think it is important to note that Austin bent over backwards trying to address the stated concerns of Uber/Lyft.

First fingerprints were too expensive, so the city said they will pay for them.  Then they said the process of getting them was too inconvenient to get given how the companies recruit so the city said they will have mobile fingerprinting stations which they will run at onboarding events (among other things) and would handle the determination of the pass/fail.  Finally they said it would just plain slow down recruitment and be a logistical nightmare with their existing drivers so the city strengthened the language about the mobile fingerprinting, phased in the requirement, and put in language requiring the city to evaluate the program and make changes if it was affecting onboarding.

There are a number of other parts of the ordinance which I could see Uber/Lyft having a problem with (geofencing event pickup/dropoff, extensive data sharing, bans on weather related surge pricing, etc) but their publicly professed main issue was the fingerprinting.

Uber did the same thing in Corpus Christi ,Texas not long ago... smaller city so it didn't get the news fair Austin has gotten over this.

I think Ubers main concern is globally.  If they break, it would make presidence for other cities to do more in the future.  It's clear they lost as Corpus, Houston and Austin have all stood their ground and Uber is out.  Eventually, and I believe soon Uber will have to crack.. Investors will force them too.

5223 :: Uber and Lyft pull out of Austin after locals vote against self-regul...
This hurts a lot of people who use Uber/Lyft to commute here.

I usually pay $4.60 for a Lyft that takes me around 10-12 minutes to get to work, door to door. This is no issue for me to pay for, given that I only use it 4x a week and I don't own a car. My work gives me $100 a month to commute for not taking a parking spot in our building (that is provided as a $100 after tax bonus, not a reimbursement, so if I lived next door and walked I would still get all $100).

This morning I had to pay $3.50 to take the bus, which to be fair does stop right outside my apartment, but took 45 minutes to get me to work. I left my apartment at 8:35 and waited 13 minutes for the bus (no time tables since it's a "rapid" bus and stops every 10-12 minutes during peak times). I got on the bus at 8:48 and got off at 9:13 at the stop closest to work. I then walked 7 minutes to work. Total time was 45 minutes.

So I saved $1.10 and it took 3-4x as long to get to work. I would love to take public transportation more, but at that speed and price, it definitely was not worth it. A cab ride to work costs $20, and if Lyft used to cost that much, I would have always taken the bus unless it was an emergency. But for only $1.10 more than the bus I can get an instant pick-up and 3x shorter ride.

Edit: Just want to emphasize, given the replies I am getting, that I am pro-public-transit. If we had more dedicated bus lanes along major transit corridors, then the bus ride might be faster than driving yourself or taking a TNC. This is something I want to see, and I would enjoy taking the bus then. I don't feel buses are unclean or sketchy, and it was actually a fairly nice ride. It just took a long time. I already wake up at 6am to workout, and it can be hard to make sure I get to work by 9 sometimes when I can't rely on Lyft. The "Rapid" buses here in Austin literally don't run on a schedule, it only says "every 10-12 minutes during peak times" and "every 15-20 minutes otherwise". Lyft is definitely priced too low to be sustainable, but many people chose to use it on a daily basis, and Lyft encouraged it with their "Lyft for Work" and "Lyft to School" promotions/features.

The NSA/Military is the problem.

He tried to join the special forces at first, and if he hadn’t broken both his legs in basic training, he wouldn’t have ended up in intelligence. But he did, and he was one of their best and brightest. He was an undercover spy for the CIA in Switzerland, worked for the NSA and its contractors all over the world, and was recognized as one of their top IT specialists.

> “He carried around a copy of the Bill of Rights, sent whistleblower notes up the chain of command, disrupted meetings to argue that what they were being asked to do was against the law. After literally years of this, he was so frustrated that he literally risked a firing squad to go public with what he knew, and ended up in seemingly permanent exile in an autocratic basket-case state, Russia, where he is in constant peril.

5215 :: "America does have a cybersecurity problem – but the NSA is part of it."
This article makes it clear that the idea of trading an amount of freedom and liberty in order to ensure security *never* works out in the people's interest.

Organizations like the NSA were ostensibly created and comprised of people just like the subject of this article, or Edward Snowden, who have the interests of the common person in mind and want to be true public servants. However once an inevitable amount of malice is introduced, paired with the workings of bureaucracy, it produces an organization that is both dangerous to the basic rights of a population, and is ineffective at achieving its stated goal in the first place. Thus they will do anything to merely survive and sustain themselves, and if that includes violating the Constitution or breaking other laws, then so be it.

The clear realization that needs to be made is that trading our freedom for security will never work, and will only ever produce organizations that further oppression. We've seen the exact same issues with the CIA and TSA too, which shows a pattern is emerging.

To be honest, this is a shitty article. The article builds well at the beginning and middle, with all the hallmarks of sound writing. I was immersed in the story, and interested in what the author had to say.

At the climax of the article, instead of an insightful discussion, what the reader got was a several paragraph editorial by the author as he talks down to the student asking the question (which I doubt the quote as it was written was the quote as it was said). The "conversation" was completely one-sided, shut down by the author's opportunity to proselytize his viewpoint.

I completed reading the article feeling I'd been ripped off into thinking there was some substance. It seems would would have been a lot easier for the author to just write what he wanted to say, without fooling readers into thinking there was something else at play.

I once had the best landlord.

He purposefully numbered our parking spots with letters, A-N. Our units were numerical. And A did not pair up with the Unit 101. He felt we had a right to privacy, in case one of us were being followed and that person knew what kind of car we drove. He also told us to never tell anyone, even the police, if a particular person lived in the complex, and to simply instruct them to contact the landlord. He really believed in our privacy.

The company Vigilant Solutions sued the State of Utah in 2014 for banning license plate readers. They think that by not allowing them, it is a violation of the 1st Amendment. 

The concern here was especially how the collected data could be used. The cameras not only take mass pictures of license plates that pass by them, but they time-stamp those pictures, note the direction the cars were heading and stores all that information. Would this constitute a search without a warrant basically.

Not sure if this is completely related, but I live in a small town outside of Boston. On my way to work one morning, a car completely cut me off and started going five mph below the speed limit. Naturally, I'm driving on the car's tail for it's too early in the morning for this kind of stuff. End up getting to work and get on with my day. Around five o'clock that day, I received a phone call from my mom saying that an officer at my local police department wanted me to call her at her office because I "tailgated" her that morning, and to call as soon as possible for she was leaving her shift in ten minutes.

So, turns out, the car that cut me off and was going unreasonably slower than the speed limit was an off duty police officer, who proceeded to write down my license plate, look up my registration information, use my name to look up my family's records in the local police department server and find my mother's telephone number to call and try to intimidate her so she could tell me not to tailgate again. 

Naturally, I didn't call her because fuck that, firm example of how police abuse their power behind the scenes.

My issues with this article:

1) This is a blog post from the personal site of a relatively famous but decidedly partisan independent journalist.

2) The post has an editorialized title and appears to provide analysis solely or primarily to confirm a pre-existing opinion. 

3)  The poster's evidence includes limited excerpts from a description of aspects of the intended policy--that is, a second-hand source with the poster's opinion repeatedly sandwiched in between. 

4) The poster's analysis includes phrases like "hypothetically" and "it's quite possible", yet his or her conclusions are affirmed in absolute terms like "false", "they're still __", and "unmistakable". 

5) I am not convinced that the poster can fairly or adequately represent the legal context for the described policy change. The law is complex and extremely intricate. It often requires specific knowledge of multiple precedents and the larger legal code. 

Although I recognize the nature of this subreddit, I would prefer that future submissions meet a higher bar for quality, primarily because I would like to know more about the subject, not less.

I remember in the last 80's or 90's seeing a news clip on something similar.  An older man had throat cancer and could no longer speak, and relied on an expensive device to talk, and the sound came out like a robot voice.

Well his grandson had a toy, it looked like a small plastic robot, but had a plastic tube coming out the back.  If you put the tube in your mouth and spoke into it, it would sound like a robot. Pretty cool.

Well, for fun he gave it to his grandpa, and lo and behold, it sounded just like his expensive device.

5182 :: Steve Wozniak on education, engineering & Apple -- "Steve Jobs played...
The tale of two Steves has fascinated me for a long time now.

When I was a kid, I got to play with a Commodore Pet. Later on, we bought a computer. After considering the Apple ][+, the Sinclair ZX-81, and (very briefly!) the TRS-80 (probably the CoCo), we ended up with the Atari 400. Great machine.

But when it came to talking about computer history, it was all Apple; and "Apple" meant Woz. It was always Woz and the other guy named Steve that nobody really remembered much.

Fast forward a few decades, and Jobs==Apple. Stranger still, he was considered a tech guru, despite having few tech chops.

Glad to see Woz is coming back into the spotlight a bit. I know it's not his most comfortable place, but he deserves it.

500
5182 :: Steve Wozniak on education, engineering & Apple -- "Steve Jobs played...
Woz has never been shy about his comments concerning Jobs, so it's unfair of any redditor to accuse him of kicking Jobs while he's dead and unable to defend himself.

It's historical fact that Jobs designed almost none of the original Macintosh products, hardware or software.  Go through previous documentaries and interviews about Apple's history.  It's mostly Woz and his team.  Jobs was there for overall vision, and pushing the marketing to get the name Apple out there.  

There was a Noah Wyle movie Pirates of Silicon Valley that had a pretty scathing interpretation of Jobs' personality.  Woz came out and said the film is about 90 percent accurate; that it really was like that.  The one scene that really bothered me about Jobs was he didn't bother to give stock options to an original designer/engineer/whomever who was there from the start, even when Woz confronted him about it being unfair.  Woz did the right thing and gifted some of his own options to make sure the guy was taken care of.  Jobs dismissed it as "whatever, fine" and walked away.

Much as I like Woz, my favorite Jobs story was from Al Alcorn of Atari & how Jobs kept poaching new engineers from Atari for Apple. Even after repeated phone calls from Alcorn to stop, Jobs kept doing it so Al tells his team to stop manufacturing 2600's & they were going to make & market a computer to go against Apple (which was nowhere near the monolith it is today). Al also knew secrets easily got out of Atari so they went through the facade & Jobs called Al a few weeks later and simply said 'Message received.'

Wrong thing to argue.  Apple should be arguing that he knew the risks when he signed the work order at the Apple store (which traditionally says that you agree to the wipe).  By arguing that he didn't suffer any loss, they're just asking for a jury to side with the plaintiff.  He obviously suffered a loss, it's just happens not to be Apple's fault.

Years ago I set an employee up with a new machine, transferring her data from the old machine to a new one. 

Set her old machine aside for a week. Asked her if she had everything she needed. She said yes, so I formatted the drive and sent it out for recycling. 

Next day she says she can't find her wedding plans. So apparently she didn't have everything and her old data was now permanently gone. 

She complained to her boss and my boss, they both said the same thing to her: Do you have what you need to do your job? Because you shouldn't be making wedding plans on company time. 

She accepted it and moved on and even apologized to me for getting angry at me. 

But her friend at work wouldn't let it go and would harass me about it daily. That eventually cost her her job. 

Over the years I've been amazed at the number of people whose personal lives are comingled with their business data. I get that 'everyone does it', but that doesn't make it a good idea.

They make it very clear that you need to have their shit backed up. The genius will usually ask a couple times but even still it's your responsibility. When you sign the work order you agree to them possibly wiping the device. If it's a software issue a wipe is more or less guaranteed. IIRC there's also a pop up confirming that you understand. 

If what was on his phone was "His life" he should have backed it up.

TLDR he agreed to the wipe and signed off on it whether he read or not.

I ran a deep scan of my hard drive and recovered about 2/5ths, many of which are thumb nail quality now. Google sent an email saying sorry, nothing else, and I haven't looked at any of those photos I still have for over a year, as everytime I open that folder now I notice all the things which are missing.

Plz back up your important photos on a physical external hard drive people!

This will probably get buried, but:

1) According to the Evening Standard, the man won the case for a total of £2,000, less than the £5,000 he was seeking. Source: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-pensioner-sues-apple-and-wins-after-tech-giant-wiped-treasured-honeymoon-photos-from-his-a3126511.html

2) It doesn't sound like this necessarily happened as part of a Genius Bar appointment. If it had, Apple's defends would've been pretty iron-clad - as many of you have pointed out, he is warned before coming into the store, several times during the appointment, and signs a work authorisation explicitly stating that Apple is not responsible for loss of data. However, for a basic troubleshooting case, the man may have simply walked into the store and asked for help. There are many sales representatives who are happy and have the knowledge to help people sort through basic issues, such as the spammy texts he was receiving. It's extremely unlikely that they would go to the point of erasing the phone on the shop floor, but it's possible, and it's possible (though unlikely) that the sales rep (who is not a trained tech) didn't ask him if he has a backup before erasing the phone. The originally incident happened this time last year, meaning the store would've been flooded with temporary seasonal workers who don't necessarily know what they're doing, because they don't receive the same amount of training that normal employees do.

3) Regardless, that's a dick defense for Apple to take. They have to argue this, because otherwise it opens a HUGE Pandora's box of problems for customers who have accidentally had their products wiped for one reason or another. But to say, "He has yet to demonstrate he lost something of value" is a dick way to put it.

5166 :: Once Again, Piracy Is Destroying The Movie Industry... To Ever More R...
There is a Bullshit angle to this entire saga, that's been bugging me for a while now.

We are always quoted box office numbers in *dollars*, not *tickets*.  Things sound impressive, but how much of it reflects reality?  They keep jacking up the prices of the tickets due to inflation, and then gaming the numbers further by throwing the normal tickets into the same pool as the 3D (+2$), the IMAX (+3$), the IMAX 3D (+4$) and the Ultra IMAX AVX, 3D + Electric Scrotum Massage (+9$)

I wish there was a meaningful  number, like Nielsen TV ratings:  how many tickets were sold, what percentage of the population as a whole that represents, and what percentage of the moviegoing public that represented at the time; in other words, what "share" the movie got.

Is movie viewership actually going up or down?  What about movie viewership relative to population?  If "piracy" is "hurting" movie viewership, it seems to me that "% of the population watching movies" and "% of people who watched this movie in the theatre vs caught it on Netflix a year later" and numbers like that would be the real ones.  

Oh, and "% of people who said Fuck It, I'll Pirate It, It Looks Dumb Anyway"

I did a research paper on piracy in college, and it's pretty fuckin' apparent that piracy is a service issue, not a cost issue. 

Look at all the services that have popped up and MASSIVELY thrived in the internet age, all of these arguably make life easier for pirates: Steam, iTunes, Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, etc.

The music, video game, and television industries are starting to adapt, they're figuring shit out. The movie industry needs to do the same.

5166 :: Once Again, Piracy Is Destroying The Movie Industry... To Ever More R...
What piracy has done is change the shape of the market, not reduce its size overall.

Hollywood is doing more reboots, sequels, and adaptations. This is because piracy has made the initial opening week much more important, and it's cheaper to generate a day-one audience with a known property than it is with an original movie.

Marketing is expensive. Inception, which was a wholly original story that was a huge success, cost over $100 million in marketing costs. And that was for a director (Chris Nolan) who was very well known thanks to The Dark Knight. Marketing gets cheaper if you just have to remind people of things they already like--like Star Wars, or James Bond, or Iron Man.

Look at the top grossing movies for 2015: 14 out of the top 20 movies are extensions of previous properties. Even Ant-Man (which I credit as a stand-alone) was partially marketed as part of the Marvel Universe.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2015

Compare to 2000: 2 out of the top 20 were sequels, and 4 were adaptations.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2000

Going 15 more years back to 1985: 5 of the top 20 were sequels, and 1 adaptation.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1985

The argument for piracy is that it doesn't really hurt big rich studios. And that is true, because big rich studios are able and willing to buy expensive rights (like Disney paying $4b for Star Wars) and market the shit out of it to land a big opening weekend.

Meanwhile, original stories have shrinking interest from big studios, and overall smaller budgets. If they take a month to get going by word of mouth in the theater, they lose money because of piracy. And more often now they have to depend on word of mouth, because there is less marketing budget available for them. It's a descending cycle.

To add, FYI: Companies that say something similar to, "this call may be monitored or recorded for quality purposes" are telling you that you have the right to record it.



**Edit:** Some of you are saying you may have to advise the agent prior to any business being conducted.  While I personally don't think that's true, it makes sense ethically.  I have not done any recording myself yet.  This could vary state to state.

**Edit 2:** It's also been brought to my attention you may need a plugin to record via Skype.  I'm not at my home computer and am unable to check atm.

**Edit 3:** /u/steelbeamsdankmemes has provided a link about telephone recording laws, it breaks things down pretty well: [Wiki link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_recording_laws)

**Edit 4:** As /u/thelazymastermind mentions, Google Voice is also a good choice to use.  

**Edit 5:** Not everyone uses their smartphones for these kinds of calls.  Example: I know someone that travels often internationally for business.  The company he owns conducts a lot of business through skype.

I just left a call center job, and in our training they explicitly told us that if we were told that we were being recorded or felt that we were, we should politely inform the customer that we could not allow that and then disconnect the call. 

Also, our calls were only recorded for "quality assurance purposes." We'd get essentially mini-trainings every day based on a random call or two that had been pulled and listened to. I know occasionally the (very huge) company we were taking calls for would listen as well, and if everything wasn't up to their standards (especially due to those mini-trainings), your ass was done for. 

I've had many customers telling me to "pull the recordings" and have even asked to speak with a supervisor because I couldn't. For that specific account, I am limited to notes left (or not left) by the previous representatives they've spoken with on the phone or on the rare occasion, if an online chat rep had noted the account. The store never leaves notes. 

So, the calls are recorded, but they're not for you. Or us.

 I used to sell vintage laptops, old, slow laptops from the early 90's. The auction clearly listed the specs (e.g 1mb ram, 10mb hd, floppy etc). One guy got caught in a bidding war and ending up buying one for $400. It was shipped to him, arrived as described. He then did a chargeback with paypal because the laptop did not contain a DVD player. Paypal sided with him , saying "expectations are that any laptop sold today should include a DVD player". 

They froze the money, he shipped the laptop back. The screen was cracked and he had written on the screen in sharpie 'go fuck yourself." - paypal gave him  his money back. I was out shipping, ebay fees and of course had a broken laptop. I sent the photos to paypal, but they said they had no way of knowing that he was the one who did it and closed the case. I shut down my ebay business that very day and have never sold on ebay since.

> Real Player is required to play almost all of the exhibits on this site. For the first couple of years we were online, Real Audio was the only streaming format and for many reasons, we believe it is still the best streaming format for us.

5154 :: Apple stops patching QuickTime for Windows despite 2 active vulnerabi...
For a lot of video and animation folks QuickTime Player (Pro) is great and can do a lot of simple editing and import/export tasks simply and easily. It's one of those tools that if you need it, it's very handy and difficult to find a full replacement for. The Pro version is also pretty cheap if you need it.

I understand why a lot of people say it sucks or it's not needed, it's not a prefect piece of software. But I think most of these comments come from people who have only used the free playback version to play a video file and may be unaware of the powerful Pro features: editing, masking, rotating, encoding or transcoding features and plug-in support that a lot of A/V people rely on.

Now QuickTime Player hasn't been updated on Windows or Mac in years. On the Mac, they replaced it with QuickTime X which is likely fine for most users. Although you can manually install the older version of QTP and pay for the Pro version which has wayyyy more editing features than QTX. 

I wish Apple would update this software on both platforms, but Apple seems to be more focused on FCP and iMovie these days. Hopefully they don't go the way of iPhoto too...
81
5154 :: Apple stops patching QuickTime for Windows despite 2 active vulnerabi...
Bad news for me. I like to use QuickTime Player to encode image sequences to .mov with the Animation codec. I find it to be great for really crisp, high-detail footage.

But from the sound of it, only using QT Player to encode wouldn't be dangerous. An exploit would require playing a questionable video with it?

If I gave my papers to a messenger in 1780 with my seal it was still *my* protected paper and a violation of my rights without a court order. If they apply 1930s understanding of what a trademarked good *is* on a form of subject, thing, or item that did not exist then, and could not have been forseen by the lawmakers, the argument to make my communications data untouchable is standing there waiting to be cited.

Twitter isn't dying in any way. The founder left the company, it showed some gains and then dropped sharply. Now founder is back as CEO and he's trying to make things right. It will take some sacrifices like this one, but that's not the end for sure. 

Twitter is still an innovative company, things like Fabric, Crashlytics and Bootstrap might not be so beneficial financially, but they can still innovate. 

IMO their problem is trying to compete with Facebook and gaining more and more users while forgetting that their service is totally different and they should pursue other paths than user conversions.

In America, it can be easy to feel that freedom of speech *just is*, like a physical law of nature. Unquestionable, omnipresent, incontrovertible.

But history tells us this is not the case. In reality, the struggle for the freedom to voice an opinion requires constant vigilance. Vigilance against people like Matthew Isham of the Lebanon Police Department.

In response, the Boston Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Lebanon Police Department, leaned on the library to shut it down. They claimed the library was supporting terrorism and criminals.

Can Tor be used by criminals? Absolutely. So can a knife. But when a criminal uses a knife, we don't go after the knife manufacturers. We go after the criminals. The Lebanon Police Department chose to go after the knife manufacturers.

The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to a free society. When Thomas Paine published Common Sense in 1776, he did so anonymously. Would the pamphlet that helped spark the revolution ever have been written if he had to put his name on it?

Anonymous communication is no less vital today. It is used in dozens of countries with oppressive governments. It was used by the reporters who broke the news that our own government has been spying on our calls and emails for years while lying to us about it.

When the Kilton Library set up a Tor node, they may not have realized they were part of an endless struggle between those who believe in freedom and those who would control us.

When they vote on Tuesday whether to continue running Tor, I hope they choose freedom. And I hope more libraries join them.

I like how the first amendment of the constitution is trampled over by this.  Tor allows freedom of speech, but the library is forced to close their Tor exit node because child porn.  

Wouldn't it be more effective, if they're worried about child porn, to go after the websites hosting the stuff rather than the Tor network?  It's like taking down the postal service because people mail bombs, rather than going after the people who made the bombs.

5133 :: The US Government Pressured a Small Local Library to Turn Off Its Tor...
I've seen many people make the same argument: "So many people use Tor for drugs/cp that it ought to not be funded by our libraries running exit nodes!" Here's a good response:

Many Tor *hidden services* are drugs/crime/cp related. Still, not all of them, by far! If public interest in anonymity increases, then you'll start seeing far more legitimate services crop up.

You can also just use Tor to access the 4.74 billion pages of the rest of the internet, censorship free. Many countries have high amounts of internet censorship and Tor helps circumvent that--running an exit node in the united states helps that cause greatly!

Many websites have both a clearnet site and a tor hidden service, for those who either have the site censored in their country or for those who prefer being anonymous. Examples:

 * Wikileaks
 * Facebook (which I find funny)
 * Blockchain.info
 * DuckDuckGo 
 * The Intercept

Here's some relevant info from the Tor Project's website:
> Ongoing trends in law, policy, and technology threaten anonymity as never before, undermining our ability to speak and read freely online. These trends also undermine national security and critical infrastructure by making communication among individuals, organizations, corporations, and governments more vulnerable to analysis. Each new user and relay provides additional diversity, enhancing Tor's ability to put control over your security and privacy back into your hands.

I'd like to add that **exit nodes do not enable people to use tor hidden services**, because exit nodes are only necessary to access the outside internet from within the tor network. Hidden services are hosted within the tor network, so no exit nodes needed!

They have repeatedly lied to congress. they were told if they did these things it would harm American business's and Americans security.

guess what all these attacks are a direct result of our weakened and vulnerable infrastructure.

I know it's anecdotal, but my company (fortune 500) has opened up two new European datacenters largely because of this, and is offloading more and more infrastructure to them. Latency will be higher for the vast majority of our workforce and customers, but it's seen as the only way to feasibly do business where privacy and security are so important.

I don't know the cost of this, but I'd assume we spent more than a few million, and it will probably move some jobs and taxable business out of US borders.

well mind you the fast track vote rn is meaningless.. its a package deal with that thing that didnt pass.. .so people were free to vote for this or against, while planning to do the opposite when it is a real vote. This is sorta saying "if we get our way, this shit will pass, see look we will take a fake vote.. see it passed.. now give us our way" which pelosi wants highway funding.


some of fasttrack isnt wholly evil.. the parts that limit debate and time are, but congress shouldnt be allowed to amend.. it should be up or down vote.  They can vote to recommend.. but if you have 20 countries in diplomatic efforts, you cant have 20 legislative bodies, looking over the agreements and sending them back with minor changes that some minor portion of some 10,000 legislators want. Too many cooks and all that. They should be able to read it.. it should be public, they should be able to take all the time in the world to vote on it.. but up or down vote is the only way this shit can work.

>Most of the ‘yes’ votes were provided by Republicans, and the majority of the ‘no’ votes were from Democrats. In both cases, the members who broke with their caucuses did so in concert with their comparative level of contributions they received from pro-fast track companies.

**Look at the actual data - this claim appears to be false.**  Many "No" votes came from individuals with majority pro-fast track funding according to the actual dataset linked.  E.g. Justin Amash, who voted no but had *only* pro-fast track funding according to their data.

It appears that the article used averages across *all* Republicans voting against the party line and used that to make the very specific conclusion above, which is false in several cases.  Not all representatives voted with their funding.

IMHO, the most egregious part about FBI's anti-Tor crusade is that it not only shows the organization has still no interest in respecting the civil liberties of the American people, but also has no interest in respecting the domestic and foreign policy of the elected U.S. government. The State department created Tor to help activists in authoritarian countries communicate without fear of reprisal. When the FBI and NSA attacks Tor, they put the lives of some of America's strongest proponents abroad at risk.

Reality TV is just the cheapest filler a network can create.  Networks are about selling COMMERCIALS.  To them, the show's content is a necessary evil.

Reality TV is something you watch cuz it happens to be on already and you don't feel like changing the channel. On Netflix or what have you, you have to make a conscious choice of what to watch. And if I'm already putting in that kind of effort, reality TV won't be what I pick.

The way of the business world is to buy a company, then start cutting down expenses to make more profit. The people who bought the company have a huge loan they have to pay back. So they start raising prices, laying off expensive workers, hiring cheaper staff, outsourcing, etc. 

They aren't making a 55 billion dollar investment to lose money. They are doing it to make money. And you don't make money by providing better service when there's no competition. You do it by cutting to the bone and sucking as much marrow from the bones as possible.

This is actually standard operating procedure. Political campaigns sell or share their contact list on a regular basis.  The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was specifically written to exclude political use from the act, so there's nothing illegal about it.

I know this because I've been pretty well trained in politics (not political science) and worked most of the past decade in email marketing.  Plus, I think I'm one of the seven people that's actually read the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.

Looks like this is not a new practice and not something unique to Repubs:

> “A lot of the folks that ran in 2012, their lists are on the market,” agreed Ryan Meerstein, senior director for Client Strategy for Targeted Victory, a Virginia-based Republican technology firm. In January, the company paid more than $1.1 million to rent list information from Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

>Democrats, including 2016 front-runner Hillary Clinton, also rent lists. A now-defunct Clinton committee garnered nearly $200,000 from list rentals in 2012; $62,782 of that was paid by President Barack Obama’s re-election effort.

That was from 2012:  http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2015/06/01/Political-fundraising-campaigns-manage-debts-by-selling-data/stories/201506010025

Edit:  and showing that Dems (including HRC) do the same thing just leads to instant downvote.  Stay classy /r/politics.

the facebook app tracks pretty much everything.  the site isnt really much better on your desktop.

ads are served based on your location, your interest, things youve liked, post youve made, people you follow, people your friends with, your friends locations, what your friends like, etc, etc.

i spend a lot on FB ads for a few of my clients and the level of targeting they have is really impressive. and also scary.  they collect A LOT of data about everything you do both on FB and anywhere else if you are simply logged into FB while browsing around.

their targeting is setup such that i can show ads to 1 person if i know their login email address or location and just a few things about them.  thats not really that crazy these days though.

i use facebook, but i set most everything to private and dont really post much, like things, or follow people.  just lurk around to see what friends are up to and to keep up with people out of town a bit.

facebook is bad.  if you can avoid it, i highly recommend avoiding it and blocking their trackers.

5064 :: The FCC just signaled war against data caps
No. No they fucking didn't.

Uggh over 6 paragraphs and they haven't even linked to the source. Honestly, the statement directly from the FCC is less sensationalized and more clear than this terrible article. Edit: sorry looks like the article did mention the seven year cap. Thanks folks!

>Washington, April 25, 2016 – In connection with the announcement by the Department of
Justice concerning the Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright House Networks transaction, FCC
Chairman Tom Wheeler issued the following statement:

>“Based on imposed conditions that will ensure a competitive video marketplace and increase
broadband deployment, an order recommending that the Charter/Time Warner Cable/Bright
House Networks transaction be approved has circulated to the Commissioners. As proposed, the
order outlines a number of conditions in place for seven years that will directly benefit consumers
by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband
deployment. If the conditions are approved by my colleagues, an additional two million customer
locations will have access to a high-speed connection. At least one million of those connections
will be in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, bringing
innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband
provider overbuilding another.

>“In conjunction with the Department of Justice, specific FCC conditions will focus on removing
unfair barriers to video competition. First, New Charter will not be permitted to charge usage-
based prices or impose data caps. Second, New Charter will be prohibited from charging
interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet
traffic to broadband customers. Additionally, the Department of Justice’s settlement with Charter
both outlaws video programming terms that could harm OVDs and protects OVDs from
retaliation– an outcome fully supported by the order I have circulated today. All three seven-year
conditions will help consumers by benefitting OVD competition. The cumulative impact of these
conditions will be to provide additional protection for new forms of video programming services
offered over the Internet. Thus, we continue our close working relationship with the Department
of Justice on this review.

>“Importantly, we will require an independent monitor to help ensure compliance with these and
other proposed conditions. These strong measures will protect consumers, expand high-speed
broadband availability, and increase competition.”

Like seven years means shit to them.  We're talking about a company that has roots over 100 years old.  Movie companies regularly plan movies 3 or 4 years in advance.  Seven years is nothing for them.  It would be like telling one of us we have to wait a 2 months before we get a free vacation to Hawaii.  They'll just put in data caps when the time limit expires.  The FCC needs to impose these rules across the board and with no time limit.
23
5064 :: The FCC just signaled war against data caps
So why are they allowing us to be screwed after 7 years?

I'm a plastics engineer and this project sounds like a nightmare. Legos have such high tolerances (edit: this is poorly worded. I meant very, very precise dimensions). Every different plastic you try will have different flow characteristics, different shrinkage rates, different durabilities, different aging characteristics... It's basically trying to get something nearly perfect (legos), and reinventing them from the ground up with a new material. That just shows how dedicated they are to the idea, and I truly applaud that kind of thinking. They are losing money to make their product more responsibly, in a global sense.

I said it over in the other thread in this subreddit, I'll say it here: The rules of the game matter. They matter a lot.

Like any other agency/department, the NSA has to abide by the rules it is given within the area that is defined in the provisions of the law or as interpreted by the department unless otherwise noted. The NSA is not some shadowy figure. They were authorized to do some shady shit. Now they are not authorized to do some of that shady shit.

I honestly don't know what is wrong with this subreddit sometimes with its rampant cynicism and pessimism and just general baseless claims. A lot of you are saying that this won't stop the NSA. Okay, well why do you think that and give an example or a source stating why allowing these few provisions within the Patriot Act to expire won't change how the NSA operates?

Headlines like this are so misleading.  The key part of the article is 

Even with the rapid growth, solar still accounts for less than 1 percent of total U.S. power production, behind coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear and hydroelectric, according to the government’s Energy Information Administration. Because output suffers on cloudy or hazy days, grid operators have to keep conventional plants on standby.

So the headline makes it sound like solar is as important as shale gas.  It isn't.  A high growth rate on a small number isn't meaningful.

Don't get me wrong, it is headed in the right direction.  But that doesn't mean we should all be googly-eyed at solar.   It has gone from a fraction of a percent to a rounding up of 1%.  I am glad it is growing, but the article headline should read: "still a trivial part of the electricity production mix, solar investment is growing faster than new investment in other energy sources."

5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
I don't think this whole thing is Netflix's idea, they're just getting the flak for it. It's the production companies that decide where their shows can be streamed and how much it will cost to do so. I remember hearing that a lot of studios simply wouldn't allow Netflix Canada to air their shows and movies because the piracy laws are so lax. Now that studios have cottoned on to users using proxies they're reluctant to sell their content or are going to up the cost.

5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
So how does Netflix know someone's using a VPN? Do they just compare the country the IP address in and the country where the credit card is?
73
5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
Y'know...if I could get a version of Netflix that had all the movies and shows that their DVD service has, but for streaming, I'd be willing to pay quite a bit for that.
462
5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
I get the fact that everyone likes being able to use VPN's to jump between different Netflix regions however banning VPN's or other work around solutions isn't Netflix's fault... if you want to assign blame assign it to the content creator.

Basic primer for how it works:

1.   I create an amazing TV show called "Butterflies vs Rabbits"
2.   I license it to Bell Canada as an exclusive for their online services in Canada... they in turn give me a bucket load of money.
3.   I license it to Netflix as an exclusive for their online service in America... they in turn give me a bucket load of money.

At this point everyone is pretty happy, however there are a bunch of viewers in Canada who don't care to use Bell Canada's service and prefer Netflix so they VPN to America and watch it there rather than signing up and giving Bell any money.

1.   Netflix is getting money from US customers they purchased the rights to show the "Butterflies vs Rabbits" to.
2.   Netflix is getting money from Canadian customers they didn't purchase rights to show to.
3.   Bell is  getting less money than it should because it knows viewers are watching a show it purchased and exclusive right to.

So Bell calls me up and is like WTF man, you told me I could have all the Canadians - however Netflix is letting the Canadians come in no problem!    I then turn to Netflix and say listen, you allowing Canadians in is going to hurt my relationship with Bell and next year they aren't going to give me my bucket load of money for my new show "Turtles wear TopHats" because your stealing their customers... you need to put in restrictions so that you don't allow viewers from countries you don't have rights to.

This happens several times with several content creators until a few of them start saying listen if you won't restrict you can't have our content anymore... eventually Netflix caves.
381
5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
Plenty of people, for example expats, use netflix overseas through VPN because it's the only way to get the content they want legally and in a timely fashion where they're living. This will no doubt lead many of those people back to torrents.

24
5041 :: Netflix's VPN Ban Isn't Good for Anyone—Especially Netflix
This is not Netflix's fault.  It's the content owners who refuse to accept that they operate in a global economy, and want to continue to apply archaic business models,  These business models made sense when media was physical (movies) or geographically limited (television).  

They will continue to fail.  Netflix will continue to take mindshare of the audiences and content creators.  It won't be overnight, but these business models will eventually disappear.

What's with all the Voat bashing in the comments?

It looks like a pretty decent site with some server issues. They have way more users than most of the sites I see posted on Reddit, so I don't know why everyone wants to bash them for being small. Of course they're not as large as Reddit, but since when was that a bad thing? Growth ruined 4chan and Reddit. Probably Digg too, but I've never used that...

edit: guys if you didn't/don't like the fatpeoplehate subs, then don't go to them. It's childish to bash the entire site just because they don't banish people with idea/conversations that offend you.

I feel like when it comes to online privacy, the way questions are framed means everything. For example, if you asked "Would you be willing to allow companies to store information about you in order to provide better service, offers and discounts?", you'll get a more affirmative response than from "Are you willing to allow marketers to harvest your personal information to target ads, benefits, and services more directly to you?".

5001 :: The Online Privacy Lie Is Unraveling - A new report asserts that a la...
I've started to wean myself off of Facebook recently-- I was chatting with a friend, IN REAL LIFE, about a product, with Facebook on and the next few days I've been getting ads about the product. 

I did not search for the product. I did not search for the product category. I did not discuss the product category with anyone over Facebook in messages. I did not put it in any email. 

So I got curious and looked: Apparently they've been doing this since February of last year, when it unlocked a "feature" that listens to your background for recognizable sounds like TV shows and music, to "help you identify songs in your status updates". I absolutely do not remember turning on such a feature.

On facebook's website:

>the app converts any sound into an audio fingerprint on your phone. This fingerprint is sent to our servers to try and match it against our database of audio and TV fingerprints. By design, we do not store fingerprints from your device for any amount of time. 

But they can record what got matched after the fingerprint gets converted, then delete the fingerprint.

I use Google Now, Siri, and recently an Xbox Kinect. I've agreed in the TOS to let them listen to me *all the time*. So in a lot of ways, this is a "well I kind of deserve it" situation because if tomorrow they announce that "yeah we're listening and converting your background sounds into a profile", I can only have myself to blame.

But I feel safe because I have no idea what else it has been tracking me on. I know about [location history](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0) where it shows where you've been, and that Google photos can "recognize" things in my pictures, but I honestly don't know what that info converts to about me as a person.

The really scary thing is **I actually don't know what they know about me**. I only "don't mind" my privacy because I don't know what they actually see or track. I wish there was a button I could press with these companies that's just like "show me what you know about me, specifically as a profile"-- if you're going to data mine me, at least tell me what I've been mined of.

**Here's how you can protect, to a decent extent, your online privacy from being spread to marketers and big companies.**

Install [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/). Use [Startpage](https://startpage.com).

Download these add-ons:

* [Adblock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/)

get the [Easy Privacy list](https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/) and add it this add-on.

* [BetterPrivacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/)

* [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/)

* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE)

enabling this add-on when using the full webpage Google Translate, will not load. It's a bug. I don't know why, and I believe you have to completely disable the add-on for it to work properly. I've ended up using Bing Translate for translating web pages, and while it does not translate colloquially as perfectly, it translates just fine for readability.

* [No-Script](https://noscript.net/)

if you really want to, you can globally allow scripts, so you won't be bothered to add your own whitelist, and still have some protections against malicious scripts, but not data-marketing web page scripts

* [Self-Destructing Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/)

keep this enabled for all sites that you believe will track you across other websites, like Amazon or Google. Personally, I use No-Script and Disconnect to their full extent, so I don't bother with deleting Google cookies because this SDC add-on, deletes to the best of its ability, cookies that it acknowledges are unnecessary for anything other than personal website preferences. 

Edit: updated add-on list

______

Edit 2: Android also has a fully supported version of Firefox. I don't know how many of these add-ons are supported for Android Firefox, but it's worth a try to at least use some of them. Plus, you can sync your Firefox on Android with your desktop or laptop.

Google's version of Android and the Android that comes with your phone has terrible privacy. You aren't given enough control over what data apps and the operating system can send to various companies like Google or marketers. I recommend trying out either CyanogenMod, Oxygen (I think?), or Replicant OS. Replicant is fully freedom respecting and even fixes some serious security issues that still remain with the latest Android. It's a few versions old, so if that's not your thing, you can still try out the other two.

I also recommend getting rid of Google's Play store system, and use a different store system that gives you more control over your Android OS and applications.

They do have the power though - they can stop letting themselves be marketed to.

I registered a washer with LG so that it would be possible for them to look it up if I needed service (and I did need service). I bought it from Home Depot online, and today in the mail I received a warranty extension offer. That either came from Home Depot selling my info to the warranty company, or it came from LG selling my info to the warranty company, I'm not sure which.

Either way, they wasted their time and money, because I won't be buying it. Why? Because.... I decided I won't be buying it. If more people did that, instead of being suckered by marketers, then there would be no profit in data collection and it would simply stop happening.

There are only four basic things you need to know:

1. Marketing people are professional liars and bullshit artists
2. Don't believe a god damn thing someone who is trying to get you to part with your money is saying
3. Don't believe packages or labels on anything, they are full of shit
4. The fundamental nature of companies is to make you think you're getting a deal when you're really not

That's it. One you understand those four things, advertising stops working on you, and you're free to pursue information gathering more objectively. 

Here's a classic:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwRISkyV_B8&feature=youtu.be&t=1m17s

The Shamwow guy trying to tell you "you're going to spend $20/month on paper towels anyway". Yes, statistically speaking, you probably are. But will you spend $20/month on paper towels just to absorb liquids? No. You clean up dirt, and food, and paint, and other grimy shit that you wouldn't want to ruin your Shamwow with. At first, it sounds like a deal - that it's going to save you money, but it's actually ***COMPLETE BULLSHIT***

Plus, physics. Shit gets worn out. You think that shamwow is going to be as good as new after a few trips in the washer/drier? Nope. Nowhere did that commercial disclose the actual durability of the product. That's what marketing is - all flash, no facts, and no substance. Stop buying into it and it stops being profitable.

Privacy as we know it is dead.   You have absolutely no idea how much both the government and corporations have about you.  

If you think you can avoid being datamined....you really can't.  You will slip up.   Most people who think they've got their browser locked down with every adblocker and script blocker under the sun don't.  Or at least they don't have them configured properly.  Or they "whitelist" certain sites because "those" sites are OK.  Or there are any number of holes left in their so-called locked down browsers that are leaking data like a sieve.  

Newsflash:  They're not.  They're all doing the same shit.  And saying that your site(s) of choice are OK to whitelist because "they need the ad revenue" or "they wouldn't do XYZ" or "I don't mind blah blah blah" is the same line of reasoning that people use to say "We should vote out every member of congress....*except my representatives*.  Because "my" reps are OK.  It's the rest of congress that's fucked up".  And then we wonder why nothing ever changes.  The same shit happens here.  It's not "my" personal favorite sites.  It's the rest of the internet.

And even if you do have your browser locked down like Fort Knox....it's not a whole lot of good if you're tethered to your smartphone that's running Facebook and god knows what other apps that are tapping into your mic and just listening to your conversations, with or without your knowledge or consent.  

Corporations damn well know that 99% of consumers can and will be easily data mined -- including the "privacy conscious", most of which don't have the first clue how to properly lock down their data.  They know that 90% of customers simply don't give a shit (the whole "I'm not important enough/don't care about privacy/don't mind the ads/whatever" crowd), and 8.99 of the other 9% of people who are privacy conscious and think they've got their data locked down...don't.  The number of people who actually give a shit about privacy *and* know how to lock down their data is so small that it wouldn't even qualify as a rounding error.  

We're being conditioned...by the governments AND by corporations...to think of privacy as a last-generation relic that only those with "something to hide" cling to.  There is already a not-insignificant number of people out there who think that the only people who value their privacy are those with skeletons in their closet.  Within 10-15 years, privacy-conscious people will be looked at in the same way that we look at 9/11 truthers, anti-vaccine morons, and other conspiracy theorists.

A flipside of this is that there's no general guarantee that _not_ participating in such services affords much by way of protection.

You're already creating copious datastreams:

* Your address is available : USPS (or foreign equivalent), [USPS NCOA file](http://ncoa-upload.com/) ([more](http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2013/07/08/how-the-post-office-sells-your-new-address-with-anyone-who-pays-and-the-little-known-loophole-to-opt-out/)), DMV, voting registration, payroll processors, magazine subscriptions, addressbook snooping from _other_ parties' records.

* Your place of employment: payroll processor, banking records, LinkedIn.

* Purchases: Credit card, debit card, loyalty programs, checks, retail-site tracking (phone signal or WiFi monitoring).

* Your general consumer preferences are bracketed: Age, sex, home address, income, educational data, magazine subscriptions, purchasing daa.

* Your email exchanges: Even if you don't use Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, or other major email service providers, _people and businesses you rely on do_. If you've communicated with them, or even if you haven't, your data are there.

* General location information: cellphone tracking data.

* Annual driving data (miles): state smog data, insurance processors, toll tags..

* Online activities: IP address, ISP, browser fingerprints.

* Medical data: Hospitals, insurers, payment processors, billing services, third-party labs, drugs suppliers, etc...

* Generally: data, information, photos, events, etc., entered about you by third parties into online or offline, public or private, systems.

So: you can _try_ to take specific steps to make small portions of your data, but it's rather like building a dam when you're 1) already neck-deep in water and 2) surrounded on all sides. Until you can create a _comprehensive_ and _nonpermeable_ barrier, you see little benefit.

Opting out offers you little additional privacy, and costs you the discounts or other benefits provided.

Possible alternative: opt in but under your own terms. Fuzz data, share cards or identifiers with others, use tokens (phones, toll tags, credit cards, etc.) for a brief time, then discard them or, better, exchange them with someone else.

He makes a point in how much of our world is so focused on profit that people are being left behind more than ever. Many didn't seem to worry when it was a small group of poor people, but now with the wealth gap growing huge, it's affecting everyone. 

I don't fear though. History has shown that you can't keep people down, and if pushed, they'll simply take the wealth by force from the rich. The [Meritocracy Myth](http://www.ncsociology.org/sociationtoday/v21/merit.htm) is what really keeps the people in check.

I see lots of comments here saying this is hyperbole because Cameron is literally not as bad as Hitler.  What people don't understand is that you don't have to be literally Hitler to be a tyrant.  Spying on everyone's communications is tyranny and can lead to a worse form of tyranny.  By spying on everyone, Cameron's government acquires the ability to blackmail everyone, and therefore, control everyone.  He is building a totalitarian system.  He's not literally Hitler yet, but soon enough the British government will become like Hitler if it keeps going down the road that the right wing Tories are taking the nation down.

4987 :: Amazon Web Services go down, taking much of the internet along with it
My company has multiple large-scale apps hosted in AWS.  This had no effect on us even though we were in the affected datacenter.  Looks like it was mainly issue with API-related requests.  Servers should have stayed online, but there was no ability to modify resources and cloudwatch was down which would prevent beanstalk deployments and auto-scaling.  The lack of auto-scaling is likely what people noticed since it occurred at a low-usage time and was only resolved once Sunday morning traffic had increased.  

I suspect most US users didn't see too much of an issue.

What a bunch of bullshit.

It was no mistake. It was a deliberate action by an admin. It's not as if the footballer attempted to create an account and instagram's systems accidentally assigned someone's existing username to him.

An admin had to go in and change the account. Likely this person could easily see that it was active. He didn't do this unprompted, someone above him told the admin to do this. It was a deliberate decision and it was a deliberate decision not to speak to the owner of the account ahead of time.

So really what they said was "We're sorry that you called us out publicly. If we could sweep you under the rug without further PR damage we would".

What a pile of shit.

Remember the DVD and HD-DVD encryption keys that got cracked and leaked on the internet? They got put back up as fast as they could be taken down.

Those keys gave universal access to decrypt and rip the content of the disks.

Now imagine the key is the government backdoor encryption key.

Hackers will attack it because it is the most valuable universal key. So if they get it and release it on the internet it would basically shut the internet down as everything would be sent in plaintext.

However everyone using the previously available open source encryption tools, which would now be illegal will still be secure. So all those terrorists and criminals will still be encrypted.

This can only be used to spy on average non-tech savvy citizens as the criminals will just harden their tech.

The rest of the world is going to say "Well, we'll just use American tech products despite their compromised encryption?" Development will just move overseas and the rest of the world will move on as the American tech industry crumbles. 

Why would you attack an economic engine of your own state? It'd be like a senator from Iowa proposing a tariff on inter-state corn shipments. This bill won't win her any favors from the donors in her state, and it's not like she needs the political theater to get elected either. I don't like Feinstein, but sponsoring this bill isn't so much despicable as it is baffling to me.

4982 :: The NSA’s SKYNET program may be killing thousands of innocent people
They literally named it Skynet. They have an evil sense of humor.

Actually using machine learning to detect terrorists isn't a terrible idea. But you are going to get an error rate, and probably a high one in the noisy real world. Maybe only 50% of the people you detect are actually terrorists. Maybe it's even worse than that. We can't even test it because there is no validation set and unreliable labels.

The reasonable thing to do with that information, would be to surveil them further, search their house, or arrest them. Not assassinate them without a trial.

And the more I read the details, the more alarmed I am. The 50% figure I used above may have been way too high. The base rate of terrorists way too low and they have very little data to begin with.

669
4982 :: The NSA’s SKYNET program may be killing thousands of innocent people
The term the NSA uses in its slides is "false alarm rate". I don't know how they define that exactly. Ars seems to think they mean [false positive rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_rate), I think they mean something more akin to a [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate). My guess is they dumbed down the language for presentation to non-machine learning people.

Calculating an FDR is tricky but conceptually it would include the low base rate, and measures the fraction of false positives out of everything determined *positive*. So assuming their 0.18% 'false alarm rate' is correct (lol @ 7 positive examples) that would be 1.8 innocent people accused out of everything 1000 people accused.
51
4982 :: The NSA’s SKYNET program may be killing thousands of innocent people
I'm suspicious of the article - it seems to imply that the algorithm literally generates a kill list, but it seems much more likely to me that it's more of a "people of interest" list.
The article makes one hedge:
> We can't be sure, of course, that the 50 percent false negative rate chosen for this presentation is the same threshold used to generate the final kill list.

which is a ridiculous hedge, since it's kind of the crux of the reason this news would be alarming.

That being said, they claim to test their training on 6 positive samples, against 100,000 "unknown" samples (not even negative samples, unknown samples). Not only are there only 6, but they are 6 known to be interdependent. That's ridiculous. Surely their algorithm would just learn something dumb about those 6 people like "a terrorist is a person who knows person Y", or some other likely unrelated thing those 6 people all have in common.

4975 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers
From the article:

http://www.wired.com/2015/09/hey-fcc-dont-lock-wi-fi-routers/

>So, is the FCC mandating that manufacturers lock down the whole router—including its operating system? Not really. The guidance is more what you’d call (badly worded) guidelines than actual rules. More importantly, guidances aren’t written by the same people who write the actual regulations. In fact, the FCC explicitly told TechDirt’s Karl Bode that it’s fine with mods and open source software “as long as they do not add the functionality to modify the underlying operating characteristics of the RF parameters.” So, modding the operating system? Okay. Modding the RF parameters? Not cool.

From the referenced techdirt write-up:

https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20150831/07164532118/no-fcc-is-not-intentionally-trying-to-kill-third-party-wi-fi-router-firmware.shtml

>Curiously nobody seems to have asked the FCC what they think about all of this. So I asked, and the FCC offered me this admittedly clunky statement (note the underlined bit):
>
>>"(FCC rules) require that the devices must ensure that under all circumstances they comply with the rules. The majority of the devices have software that is used to control the functionality of the hardware for parameters which can be modified and in turn have an impact on the compliance of devices. Our rules do permit radios to be approved as Software Defined Radios (SDRs) where the compliance is ensured based on having secure software which cannot be modified. **The (FCC's) position is that versions of this open source software can be used as long as they do not add the functionality to modify the underlying operating characteristics of the RF parameters.** It depends on the manufacturer to provide us the information at the time of application on how such controls are implemented. We are looking for manufacturers of routers to take more responsibility to ensure that the devices cannot be easily modified."
419
4975 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers
I find the whole not being able to flash thing a huge deal, but I wouldn't mind if the radio itself was a separate chip with a super-locked, read-only firmware to prevent illegal power levels and bands. You get black helicopter'd for that shit anyway.
163
4975 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers
Locking out changing the wifi OS does nothing to stop the underlying hardware from operating in ranges outside of the legal ranges for the region the device was sold in. Any controls would have to be done on the radio chip itself at the time of manufacture or by the third party device manufacture to lock the hardware for the region where it is being sold. 

If the chipset can still be bought and manufactured on any board I want to design there is nothing locking me out of operating that radio device in unlicensed ranges. Sure, not a solution for your average user but there is nothing stopping me from doing that by making an unrelated company lock down their software.

An easier solution would just be to have someone in another country ship a device to me that operates in the ranges I want. Only now I would not be able to configure the OS to operate in the new region where the device is located.

The device manufacturers could also just not put an OS onboard. Add an SD slot instead of flash and provide an image that does not let you set illegal ranges. Consumers could just pop in any image on an SD card that they want. Without locking the radio chipset anything else is pointless.

The only real way to fix the problem would be to have a globally acceptable operating frequency range. Good luck fixing that.
9
4975 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers
The FCC does not, and has never, wanted to "lock down your wifi router".  They want to lock down the chip *inside* the wifi router to prevent you from exceeding FCC broadcast power limits or broadcasting on an unregulated frequency.

It's already illegal to do it, they just want to make it impossible to do it with a common consumer level product, as well.

There was already a big warning message when I installed Gargoyle on my router that said "This can unlock certain channels which are illegal in Canada and Germany, and using them can result in severe penalty or fine".  So if you're against locking down the chip to prevent that from happening, surely you're against the law that already exists as well?

4975 :: Hey FCC, Don't Lock Down Our Wi-Fi Routers
The whole thing is misguided. The problem is that the router manufacturers are cutting too many corners and bind the wifi chips with the user end software functionality. If they wouldn't bind those two things together the FCC wouldn't have to slap their wrists and force them to lock it down and in doing so lock you out.

The population which Zuckerburg actually wants to help does not need Facebook. It needs internet(the real one) and other applications which help them and their kids for basic amenities such as education,banking services, weather updates, etc., That can be through khan academy or through any small applications which gives them access to some document online. Free Basics is not the solution to it. Facebook just want to end its competition. 
Who are they to decide on the applications/websites those poor people will visit ? People would not have fought against free basics if Zuckerberg would have told that our partner will give you 300MB (or anything) data free and you can access the internet. So that they can go to google,youtube,etc., They could have tried to install some training centers to educate them about the internet. But No! they want to tell the poor Indians internet is Facebook.

The article mentions the Facebook-provided internet is "limited". Depending on how it is limited, I can understand some people's reluctance to accept it.

Edit: Based on everybody's explanations of how the Facebook-provided internet access is limited, I'm going to say it's a scummy move by Facebook and its partners. Whether it's good or bad for Indian people is somewhat debatable, but it's clear that Facebook is not doing this out of altruism. They're doing it in hopes of getting a few monopolies and to lock in a market.

Grateful for what? A huge free market penetration!

Most of the users who are supporting "Internet Basics" don't even know what they are supporting. They're just joining the bandwagon because they're receiving notifications about their friends submitting request to TRAI. 

It's clearly violates Net Neutrality. By saying that they're supporting Net Neutrality, Facebook is completely misleading half-blind Indian users.

I Request to all the users submitting support for "Free Basics" at TRAI, at least do some research before blindly supporting a campaign. It's not profile pic update that you did for supporting Digital India but far more crucial.

For Facebook, Internet that provided you the equal opportunity in the past and helped you in emerging as a multi-billion dollar entity, now you're trying to bind it in the name of "Free Internet Basics". If you truly wanna help the community, your brilliant minds can definitely figure out a way to provide free full Internet access.

I'm just going to state the obvious.

Because it's not free Internet.

'Free' Internet would be allowing people to book railway tickets, or passports online. It would be letting people download pdfs of the English alphabet, or roam around on Wikipedia, or just casually freefall through whatever they wanted to freefall through, on the Internet.

The only form of 'basic' that is agreeable, is simple, all-round bandwidth throttling. Throttle EVERYONE'S bandwidth to 30-40 kB/s? It's a shit connection, but it's impartial. You can barely watch 240p videos on it, and maybe wait for 3 minutes while a 50 page pdf downloads, or maybe go get some cooking done while your Gmail loads up. You know, like the good ol' 90s. Or 00s.

What Zuckboi is trying to do here is provide certain sites that he deems fit, available to the public, for free, while charging, or outright disallowing other sites.

You can play Candy Crush, but you can't read a 5th grade textbook of whatever to your child.

Here's why this is a problem. If you were a naive philanthopist and you saw a poor starving African village, you might be tempted to solve the problem by giving them food. Now everyone has enough to eat. Good, right? Well, it might not turn out good in the long run, because everyone stopped buying food. Why would you *buy* food when you were getting free food? So the farmers can't support themselves and go out of business, and now the community is reliant on aid and even worse off than before. It may have been well-intentioned, but it ended up undermining the ability of the community to sustain itself. When you see a group of people desperately in need of a commodity, often the best thing to do isn't to give it to them directly but to help them produce it. Build roads and schools or fight disease. Things that will make farmers more productive. It's like "teaching a man to fish" on a bigger scale. The Gates Foundation is great at this type of approach.

Of course Indians would benefit from internet, but would they benefit from Facebook's internet? What if a large enough population adopted this free service that is was more difficult for a paid open web to thrive? What if Facebook then took advantage of their monopoly and slowly raised prices? India might never see open internet, or healthy competition among internet companies. Now the situation is even worse than the example of the naive philanthropists because this "charity" is controlled by a for-profit profit-driven company, that you just know is going to use this influence to their advantage. If Zucks really wants to help Indians, he should build infrastructure alongside Indian government, not push out local businesses with extremely aggressive price cuts.

It may be that free internet would be helpful for Indians, but they are right to be skeptical. "Thanks, but no thanks" might be the best move here.

As a reminder, the treaty doesn't come into force until it is ratified and implemented by national legislatures (e.g., Congress). Now that it's agreed upon the text will be released to the public, and all the speculation about the contents (which is really all that currently exists) can end.

In the US, Congress must then wait 60 days for the public to read the document before it can vote to ratify or reject it.

I was in an Uber a few months ago. He said he used to drive Yellow Cab, but it was too stressful. Now he can work however much he wants and drives his own car, making himself more of a profit. The topic of Taxi Medallions came up, and he said that two years ago, medallions were sold for $1.2 Million, and now they're worth just $500k. And, he said that green taxi medallions were about $2,500. Uber single handedly reduced the price of taxi medallions by roughly 50%. That's no small feat, and shows just how much New Yorkers prefer Uber.

So that's like when an ISP says critics are misinterpreting data caps, but refuse to say how data caps are helping the customers, right?

Just because you've set out exemptions for this kind of thing doesn't mean it still won't be used as a tool against them.  It just means that the very specific exemptions will still be able to slip through.

4952 :: Whistleblowers fear prosecution under new European Trade Secrets law
It does sound like caution is warranted. Unlike trademarks, patents and copyrights, trade secrets are an intellectual property type that's defined by the company itself. Non-disclosure agreements and non-compete clauses are already used to protect companies, but they're also used quite sweepingly, and now it sounds like this bill would throw potential criminal liability at someone who exposed potentially *anything* about a company instead of just civil liability (or whatever the distinction in Europe is).

4952 :: Whistleblowers fear prosecution under new European Trade Secrets law
I don't really care for industrial espionage, but whistleblowers shouldn't be imprisoned for leaking secrets that damage the company.

However it does say that whistleblowers will not be jailed for acting in the public interest and exposing crimes, but I didn't see an excerpt of the proposed law saying this. If they aren't going to prosecute journalists for this, they should have more to show for it.

Edit: I understand that such an excerpt may not be publicly available until it's passed? Maybe that's the case.

Still a dangerous law if there are loopholes that can be used to prosecute citizens and not just companies

> The bill's supporters say there is nothing to worry about because it contains a defence for those who release information exposing criminal wrongdoing or who are acting in the public interest.

> But not everything exposed by the Panama papers was illegal - much of it was merely embarrassing to the people who were named.

Theoretically companies or individuals who technically weren't doing anything illegal could claim that leaking their info wasn't "acting in the public interest."

I'm okay with this. Distracted divers are a hazard, and if you read the tweets by the agency, they're straight forward and not really "scolding".

4933 :: '60 Minutes' hacks congressman's phone for security report
There's a point I don't get:

Karsten Nohl and his team were legally granted access to SS7 by several international cellphone carriers. In exchange, the carriers wanted Nohl to test the network's vulnerability to attack. That's because criminals have proven they can get into SS7.

Ok, so this attack was so easy because the German hacker already had access to the ss7 network, which is of course a lot less hacking than we were supposed to think from the introduction.

By the way, all in all good proof of concept, and they were smart to throw in the congressman card


66
4933 :: '60 Minutes' hacks congressman's phone for security report

Two days before we move in, the Verizon guy comes and hooks some stuff up. I look at it and I'm a little confused because it just looks like a DSL hook up but I don't know what FiOS is supposed to look like, so what do I know?

After we've moved in, the download speeds are atrocious. Even streaming Youtube is a hassle. We call them and ask them what the deal is. Long story short, they hooked us up to a DSL and don't offer FiOS packages to our neighborhood. The sales package was just called FiOS(?) and, really, it was our fault for not reading all about it.

I work in IT security.

The world is a very scary place. The amount of companies, *big* household name companies, that have poor security practices is quite honestly breathtaking. I've crossed dozens of businesses off my list of places I would trust my information or health to.

Maybe it's due to Hollywood, but I'd say *most* people believe that cyber-crime is done by elite hacking groups hitting high value targets. That's rarely, if ever, the case. It's more like people using authentic Victorian doors and locks, and then neglecting to upgrade them to modern locks as time progresses. Funny thing, one tumbler locks are crazy easy to open. Today's data breaches are typically the result of entirely lazy hackers sending out waves to robots to try every lock with their skeleton key. If it works, they're in! If it doesn't, they just move on to the next door and try again.

It's my job to know how to lock down a network. And boy howdy, you can screw things down extremely tight these days. But when profit margins are more important than infrastructure, you're not hiring the best security experts. Almost every day I speak to people with bachelors degrees and numerous certifications, and they didn't even bother to read the product manual. They're running their security suite with the default configuration, because no one is checking their work. And until they have a problem, no one will. Very few companies do security audits "just for fun".

IT Directors, and the bosses they have to please, tend to operate on a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mentality. The problem is, software breaks all the time. That's why we have patches, and updates, and new releases. But if you're the kind of lazy asshole who doesn't even read the product documentation, what are the chances you're keeping up to date on release notes or vulnerability bulletins? Oh, you may *think* it 'ain't broke', but when a few thousand customer records are compromised because of an SQL exploit, you're going to wish you were better at your job or you may not have one for much longer.

IMO, the reason that financial systems and payment processing models have evolved so pathetically slow over the past few decades while we now have internet terminals in our pockets, is that those industries **explicitly** value profit over innovation. The reason why you can't wave your phone at a checkout stand, have funds deducted from your account, and a receipt emailed to you in under a minute is because there's zero incentive for companies to improve the customer experience to that degree. If the market will continue to bear paper receipts, transactions by dial up, and X hours for transfers to complete, then they will *never* upgrade those systems. Not unless they're forced to.

Like most problems with crumbling and outdated infrastructure, it tends not to be a priority because most people don't know about it. And that's an enormous failing of our media and information channels. Case in point, this news story would have been just as accurate five years ago. Or, as the article points out *twenty five years ago*.

The world is a very scary place, depending on what you know.

...from one particular vendor, according to a company that sells security services. And the vendor is right that it would be hard to do anything serious / useful with the password since it can't access full credit card numbers and you have to already be on the internal network to use it. This should still be fixed, but it's really not the crazy "facepalm" thing it's made out to be.

I spent 6 years working in the Merchant Service industry.

As someone who used to program, install, and train on these machines, I can confirm this is true. 

However, someone would need to be alone with the machine for a few minutes in order to Navigate the menus and find the correct function to print data. 

I feel like even someone like myself would take some time to find the right option. 

This is because most processing companies have slightly different software/versions running the machine.

So while this is true, and very possible.
I find this to be a very improbable worry/threat.

Furthermore, this article is referring to counter top machines generally found in mom & pop stores/restaurants. 

Not the fancy POS (point of sale ;) systems found in major grocery stores and major retailers.

> In this age of communications that span both distance and time, the only tool we have that approximates a "whisper" is encryption. When I cannot whisper in my wife's ear or the ears of my business partners, and have to communicate electronically, then encryption is our tool to keep our secrets secret.

This sums it up perfectly. We are in an age where the majority of our communication has become electronic, and the idea of a "secret" is non-existent. 

On a side note, I am really interested in reading about this Charles Sobhraj story.

4906 :: John McAfee: The Obama administration doesn't understand what 'privac...
Yeah, yeah, Mcafee is crazy... that aside:

I see a big problem happening right now and I don't see it being talked about very often.  I'm late 30's.   When I was a kid I had to remember all my friends' phone numbers.  Now I don't even remember my families'.   People used to keep paper records of tax returns, mortgage records, bills, etc... now I can keep all that contained within my email.  If I have a problem with something I'm working on, I can just google it to find a solution.   If I want to learn how to do something around the house, I can just look it up on youtube.

My point is that we are off loading our own personal memory requirements onto digital mediums.  The smart phone (primarily) is becoming an extension of our our own mind.  I think people are going to have to actually start implanting electronics in their brain before society clues into this.  

If we don't start recognizing it for what it is the future could be pretty ugly in terms of privacy.  Or, even worse, maybe "they" already are aware of this and are making a power grab.

Edit:  Yes, I'm aware it's pretty much an asbolute certainty that most anti-encryption anti-privacy people know they are abusing our privacy, but I still think the majority just don't understand it.

4906 :: John McAfee: The Obama administration doesn't understand what 'privac...
It's really quite simple; if all encryption has a backdoor with a key, people are going to start looking for the key... and then it's just a matter of time before someone finds it and uses it for nefarious causes.

Businesses would have their corporate secrets stolen, governments would be spied upon by foreign nations, and corrupt officials are going to spy on innocent people...

Backdoors are bad.

I am a staunch defender of Privacy but this came off as hypocritical to me:

>Private communications have saved my property, my businesses and even my life more times than I care to count.

>On my first trip to Kathmandu as a very young man I encountered a charming and charismatic Asian man who invited me on a private trip to Pokhara to visit his family homestead. His name, he said, was Charles Sobhraj. I was enthralled.

>A gentleman sitting at the same restaurant **overheard** the conversation and when Charles left momentarily to visit the restroom, the gentleman leaned over and quietly said: "Do not go with this man. He will kill you and take your money."

It was because your conversation wasn't private and someone overheard it and intervened that you are alive. It is a terrible example to use and one that the government would point to and say "see if we had access to your conversations we could save you."

I was told I would receive paperwork tonight for each abandonment. Holding comment until I see if they've truly done away with each descriptive mark.

**EDIT:** Benny Fine has given me proof that they surrendered registration of TEENS REACT and KIDS REACT, and they have abandoned their applications for ELDERS REACT, REACT, PARENTS REACT, CELEBRITIES REACT, ADULTS REACT, TRY NOT TO LAUGH, LYRIC BREAKDOWN, KIDS VS FOOD, DO THEY KNOW IT, and PEOPLE VS TECHNOLOGY. 

That means they've abandoned ALL marks that were in question. They heard our collective voice, and they responded. While, sure, this response was driven mostly by fear and a lightning fast unsubscribe rate, there’s no reason to keep our foot on the gas.

Is what they did initially right? No, of course not. But I didn’t offer my services to destroy their company or see endless employees laid off, and I hope you didn’t either. The internet gets hungry with vengeance, I know, but these are peoples’ lives. People who made a huge mistake, but a mistake they’ve corrected. 

I hope you let people who enjoy the Fine Bros work continue to do so. I hope you don’t troll their comment section or lead brigades against their content. They don’t own the react genre, but it would be silly to say they aren’t one of the best at it.

They're voicing opinions of politicians and judges. I disagree with them, and I think that police forces need to do some serious reforms in many instances, but they can say whatever they want short of incitement.

I'm all for openness and think that there are a lotl of things that should be public that aren't but, I will draw the line at the posting of their home addresses.

There are too many men and women that are on the force that are doing a great job, following the law, and truly are serving the public. 

The publishing of their addresses puts them and their families in danger from people that may have a personal grudge against all police officers or may have been rightfully arrested by them and they are wanting to exact revenge.

If you have their online personas and want to publish those or some inflammatory postings, have at it. If you have proof of corruption, by all means, publish that, but leave their families out of it.

4902 :: Elon Musk personally bans blogger from buying a Tesla Model X
reposting top-level: 

In the interest of local color: the 'blogger' in question is actually a mediocre VC whose greatest claim to fame may well be when he backed out of doing (what would become) PayPal's first external round of financing at the last minute. Admittedly, this was because Elon's staff had all just walked out on him (not that that stopped the legendary Mike Moritz from not only doing the deal, but wiring $5mil without any papers even signed to help save the situation) - my point is just that there is a *lot* of history that essentially everyone ITT is missing.

edit: **eli5/tl;dr: the 'blogger' is an investor who has interacted closely with Musk over two decades, including the memorable time in 1999 when he (for cause) pulled out of financing Musk's then-startup PayPal. Not some rando. He and Musk go way back.**

4902 :: Elon Musk personally bans blogger from buying a Tesla Model X
Not a Tesla or Musk fanboy by any means, but is it just me, or there are some inconsistencies in this guy's story?

From the [first Medium post](https://medium.com/@salsop/dear-elonmusk-you-should-be-ashamed-of-yourself-ca3d266882a4#.z9lpglc4o):

> Starting a 7:00pm event at 8:50pm is simply unacceptable

From the [second post](https://medium.com/@salsop/banned-by-tesla-8d1f3249b9fb#.x4evecja3):

> You mentioned that you believed that the event only started 30 minutes late at 8:45pm (even though the invitation insisted that everybody be at the venue by 7:30pm sharp).

So, is it a 7.00pm event or 7.30pm event (as the invitation says)? Also, the post says there were about 3,000 people at the event.

If that's the case, and the invite says to be present at the venue by 7:30pm sharp, that means that the event is not expected to start for another 30 minutes at least until all the people are accommodated. Hell, I've waited longer for some events with much less attendees.

Also, bashing the presentation definitely is a personal attack:

>And then, drum roll please, you shuffle out on stage and start with a slide show -  an amateur slide show at that  - all about how safe the Model X is. Yup, you lead with safety, like that’s why we’re all spending $130,000 or more on this car!

Well, there are no excuses as to why the event was late at all, and I think Elon (and Tesla in general) should've both apologized and catered some food as the people were clearly waiting, but all of this just sounds as an exaggeration by a disgruntled customer.

Yes, canceling his Model X order is a dick move, for sure. But it's nothing unheard of in the car industry. I'd go as far as to say that it's common practice among high-end car manufacturers.

4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
Encryption backdoors are missing the point.

If you by law require all encryption to have backdoors, a few things happen.

First, private encryption research leaves the US. It leaves any country which requires backdoors. This isn't even speculation, we saw this happen in the 90s where encryption merely suffered from export restrictions.

Second, Everyone who cares about encryption switches to these outlaw encryption tools. This means that actual terrorists/criminals using encryption continue to be safe. This means that people who merely want to protect their privacy become criminals.

Third, As is usually pointed out first, encryption everywhere in the country becomes only as secure as a single master key. When(not if) that key leaks, all encryption is broken. The only people safe from this are the criminals.

Encryption backdoors are bad for security, bad for the tech industry, bad for consumers, and unhelpful for law enforcement. The only thing they're good for is bulk surveillance.
541
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
I have been working with FIPS 140 and FIPS 186 since 1999. Encryption back doors are never going to happen. Even if new algorithms are introduced that have back doors, we will continue to use existing algorithms with increased key size. 

Encryption back doors is one of the stupidest debates I've ever read. It's not going to happen. 

Edit: We (the federal government) do have encryption key escrow actively working for PIV and CAC programs (FIPS 201). it is a published standard and under extreme rigor in terms of two party control and audit in order to retrieve encryption keys for use if keys are lost, stolen, used nefariously against government data, or for criminal investigations (requires warrant/MP). 


180
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
Politicians who ask computer scientists to build safe encryption with backdoors should be asked why they don't make laws that completely prevent 100% of all crime in the first place. 
140
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
an encryption back door is like not having a door to begin with

edit: without secure encryption there is no security from anyone, government being the least of worries, so essentially there is no doors, not a back door in any way (which would indicate moderate security, when in reality there is none)

the entire point of encryption is to be secure in the fact that NOBODY can intercept/read a message without the key.  poke holes in any of that it is no longer encryption
208
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
My wife isn't technically minded but once I explained how the government would use the back door it took her 30sec to ask how long would it take for some one to hack it?

She then asked what uses encryption online? What about payment transactions and emails and passwords would the be affected too? 

If a laymen is shocked by this why aren't more people shocked too?
8
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
I always found that a good analogy for encryption back doors was something like this:

Imagine that you're shopping at a store and you're getting ready to pay, so you hand over your credit card to the clerk. He, quite loudly, shouts your number out loud in an unintelligible language so the bankers across the street can hear. The bankers look up your information and shout back a response. Now imagine this was happening everywhere all the time: you're walking down the street and you hear English and also this obscure language. People's mundane conversations overlaid with unintelligible secrets. 

For a while, no one would know what the fuck anyone is saying, until some genius figures out that they're all just speaking Esperanto and if they just learn it, they'll have access to everyone's bank accounts. 

That's what a back door would be. A universal key that, once learned, would make anything encrypted with open for the world to read. 
31
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
The politicians who want encryption back doors are so fucking irresponsible it makes my blood boil.  Do they not understand that they will be making online banking and online shopping impossible?  Online banking and online shopping depend on secure encryption to prevent hackers from stealing money and credit card numbers.  Encryption back doors will hurt many businesses, big and small.  It's not just a threat to our civil liberties.
8
4893 :: A key under the doormat isn’t safe. Neither is an encryption backdoor.
I think we need to ask ourselves what privacy really is. We trust that our mail is private. It is only intended for the addressed recipient, and there are laws to prevent unauthorized people from opening or tampering with mail. However, it is not secure. Anyone can read your mail, and the FBI can do so with legal permission. We know this is true but we accept it because securing our mail would be too much effort just to communicate. Are we ok with this level of security, or have we only tolerated it because it was convenient?

Today with electronic messages we actually have the capability of real security, and the potential to prevent anyone besides the intended recipient from understanding the message in a convenient manner. FBI and law enforcement doesn't like this because they have always had a backdoor. They can tap your phone or open your mail with permissions to investigate. 

So the question is, how secure should we go? Now that technology is starting to allow for it, do we lock everyone out of our communication? Or do we allow some people to view under certain circumstances, knowing that it could be exploited, like opening your mail? 

Given the prolific nature that information spreads, it can be assumed that any encryption backdoor that is found will be spread, essentially nullifying that type of encryption. Remember how HDDVDs and BluRay encryption was uncrackable? That crypto key is on Wikipedia today.

I can't wait for the insurance companies to get involved in the Uber controversy. It hasn't been addressed yet, but ride-sharing for money is extremely problematic when it comes to insurance, and the first major accident to hit the news will probably bring this issue to the forefront. Even if Uber survives taxi medallion litigation, they might die to insurance lobbying.

as a frequent business traveler, I want a cab that gives me a consistent payment option, is cheaper, and does not try to scam me using untested phone apps on the personal cabbie's phone to scan my card..

The cab company (Yellow) in Seattle is very hit and miss for if their card-swipe-reader is working, if they can print me a receipt, or if they can take credit cards at all.  Their drivers try to make you use Square, which is plugged into the cabbie's own phone.


Uber takes cards, every time, the driver speaks English, every time, and they get me where I need to be without hassle and bullshit, every time.  And the card is already entered in Uber's system, I don't have to give my card to a cab driver using a phone app to pay.  That is ridiculous.  Or let the cabbie hand-write a receipt.  Sorry guys, my employer won't let me expense trips like that.  Must be a real receipt.

The taxi companies are terrified of losing their terrible service to something new. It's fear that has caused this lawsuit and nothing more.

Every time I see one I can't help thinking of The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy:

"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

---Samsung sold 1.2M in all of 2014

Apple has so far sold over 7M since release

Then again, how many watches sell ~20.000 units a day?

That's a million every two months (using an average of 15.000 for the sake of argument). Far far more than all Wear watches combined too.

I dunno, the total number of watches sold is probably pretty big. And I'm sure Apple wasn't expecting to sell 50 millions or something crazy. But enough to get the word out and have smartwatches associated with them, plus another neat adition to their ecosystem.

These look like good numbers for now, the real test is for the second and third model, we'll see if smartwatches are here to stay or are a passing fad.

For contrast, Apple sold ~4 million iPhone 6 models on launch day. So if Apple sold 40,000 phones yesterday alone, one could say that current iPhone 6 sales are down 99% from the initial rush, right?

Apple sure isn't saying anything about the sale of the watch. So, somehow, somebody has to make a guess:

> Slice bases its research on electronic receipts sent to millions of email addresses following purchases.

How does that work? They sit around in each Apple store and sniff out wifi packets to capture email receipts sent after purchase? How do they capture those when you buy online?

It bothers me that so much unsubstanciated guesswork is presented as facts.

The FBI and NSA have been violating our privacy systematically by strong arming tech companies into violating our rights on their behalf so they can get around the law. The FBI cannot compel me to reveal my interests, preferences, political views, and other very private information about myself. But they can use regulatory threats and tax incentives to strong arm Facebook and Reddit into voluntarily handing over that information on me that they collect, so that the FBI gets access to it without technically breaking the law. If people don't understand how dangerous this is, then they really need to wake up and read the writing on the wall.

Law enforcement in the US (which is part of the Executive Branch) isn't supposed to be all powerful.  It is supposed to be hampered and restrained by the Judicial Branch (yes, you may LOL).

Congress has been far too lazy, granting the Executive many of their own powers instead of overseeing it, and even legislating authority where it had no legal right to (National Security letters are unconstitutional, but SCOTUS hasn't bothered to slap those down).

The FBI director may be scared shitless, but he's not afraid of ISIS terrorists - he's afraid of being hoisted upon his own petard by the American public through Congress when the full scope of crimes committed under his watch become clear.

"Hi, We're the FBI.  We need to break into all mansions to protect/audit them, so please put in a backdoor, label it, "FBI ONLY" so the bad guys don't use it to burgle you."

The tech industry can build almost anything, but c'mon.  Any backdoor can be used by any hacker, white hat or black hat.  There's no solution to that.  Get a friggen warrant, and the front door will open. THAT'S the solution since the Magna Carta.

4872 :: Malware is not only about viruses – companies preinstall it all the time
I take perverse pleasure in helping friends who bring their laptops to me, complaining that their i7/8Gb RAM unit is "sloggy" after just six months from the store. So much legal, computer-hijacking stuff hidden in Acer/Toshiba/Dell/HP computers.

I uninstall all the preinstalled Norton/Symantec stuff (usually recommend a free edition antivirus combined with Windows Defender/MSE), remove the PowerDVD/Roxio crap the client doesn't use, the MS Office Trial Version crap (Apache Openoffice/LibreOffice is fine), then I go through the Windows startup queue and remove all the Spotify/Quicktime/Itunes/Bank ID/Dropbox/Steam/Outlook/Weather News autostart crap, check Windows Update for optional/hidden updates, restart, and lastly finish off with a system registry/trash cleaning.

Last software thing is to do a Windows Experience Index update, and whaddayaknow? In many cases, after sorting out both hardware and software issues, half or most of the scores have increased by 1 or 2 points.

Physical: Compressed air (generator, not spray can, spray cans in this town blow weaker than my great-grandma) into the keyboard and the laptop fans (secure the fan blades with a small screwdriver so their fittings don't melt from turning too fast), removing all that pubic hair, breadcrumbs, weed, and cat fur. Scoop the dirt together into a little demonstrative pile, for customer satisfaction.

Wipe down exterior with screen-safe cleaning product, alcohol rub on the mousepad and external mouse. Remove the humongous factory "Features!!" stickers on the left and right side of the mousepad.

New computer, presto. That'll be 60 bucks/hour or a ribeye steak dinner, please.

Edit: For those who think I did very few changes to the computer above, I expanded in a response below that I always do a lot more things than that, but we were talking about Factory-installed malware stuff. Usually I help people go through their bookmarks and delete duplicates/dead links, sort email folders, pictures, transferring photos from cameras to computer, install wireless printer, fix their WiFi so they get the strongest possible signal from it, help with creating additional email adresses, basically anything computer-related, even reinstalling Windows and downloading all the necessary drivers for the laptop in question (many people throw away their software discs).
It usually takes three to five hours, an entire evening. They pay not just for my time, though, but for 20 years experience with finicky comps.

My 60 dollars per started hour is taxfree (and doesn't include travel time), which is a hell of a lot better than most computer outlets in Stockholm, whose technicians start off at 120-180$/h before VAT.

As for PowerDVD, yes it has its uses as a Bluray disc viewer, *IF* you have a bluray reader (most cheap laptops don't), and *IF* you have a full version. The trial version is just that, a trial, and then you need to pay, which 90% of people won't want to do since they don't watch blurays on their laptop. PowerDVD is still a very bloated and sluggish software and any other alternative (Mediaplayer Classic, VLC, etc) is preferable from an intuitive end user standpoint.

Snowden is an American hero imo, and I have tons of Military friends (who are all heroes too). He risked life and freedom to bring this to light to the American people, and has lost nearly everything in the process. He needs to be FULLY pardoned PUBLICLY, Presidential apology given and he deserves a damn metal. He should also be paid for all lost wages, pain and suffering, and be given a position where he is in charge in some aspect of oversight for out govt for things just like this. He has proven that he has our(the people) best interests in mind and seems to only release stuff that will not damage USA more than necessary.

People need to understand that the Snowden leaks are easily separated into two broad categories: domestic surveillance and international surveillance.  

The NSA reform that just passed Congress is about one aspect of domestic surveillance (bulk metadata collection) that was the subject of the very first Snowden leak published.  When it came to light, Congress moved toward reform and a federal court ruled it was illegal. That is whistleblowing, and Snowden should be protected from any charges stemming from that leak. 

But the vast majority of Snowden's leaks fall into the latter category: international surveillance.  This includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  And there's nothing illegal--much less unconstitutional, about foreign surveillance. Leaking classified information just because you personally disagree with a program is not whistleblowing. 

Snowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), (not for treason), which applies to:

>**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which ***information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

Now why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.

[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): 

>“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.”

[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):

>Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....
>
>...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.
>
>They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.

[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):

>Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. “Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,” Greenwald said. “***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***”

[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):

>I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation

So even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to "ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.

Here's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:

> Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.
> 
> Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing. At least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that.
> 
> **But now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into China and all this kind of thing. He is going a little bit too far. I don't think he had access to that program. But somebody talked to him about it, and so he said, from what I have read, anyway, he said that somebody, a reliable source, told him that the U.S. government is hacking into all these countries. But that's not a public service, and now he is going a little beyond public service.**

> **So he is transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor.**

To the people mentioning foreign surveillance leaks, I do agree some were ill-advised (China, etc), though I think he was right to reveal the US was spying on ordinary people across the globe. If I were in charge, Snowden would serve a few years in prison, but guys like Clapper and Petraeus would also serve time. I cannot support punishment for Snowden right now though, with this distorted rule of law.

True patriots charge in when it is NOT safe to do so out of bravery and a deep sense of national duty.  Snowden is a patriot and deserves all our respect.  The spooks hate him for shining a light on their ugly little mess, shame on them.  When will they face justice for ignoring the constitution?

4842 :: How Forbes inadvertently proved the anti-malware value of ad blockers
I would argue that it IS Forbes fault for serving malware. They knowingly choose the ad network. Thus it's their fault. 

EDIT:
And if they deny the use of ad blockers I would argue it is even more their fault. Like requiring people to turn off anti virus to view the website.

4842 :: How Forbes inadvertently proved the anti-malware value of ad blockers
Big sites could perhaps start demanding a clause in their contracts with ad providers that require compensation for lost revenue / bad publicity resulting from these phishing popups appearing on their site. Losing money is probably the only way ad networks might decide to pay attention.

I totally disagree - it is absolutely Forbes' fault.  100%, with no room for excuses or bullshit.

They choose an ad provider and Forbes is still responsible for their content.  They may have lawyers that can make the ad provider responsible, but it's Forbes' website that handed out the viruses.

You didn't get E. Coli poisoning from my restaurant, you got it from my lettuce provider.  Bullshit.

4838 :: Nintendo president Satoru Iwata has passed away
This is sad. I worked at Nintendo while Iwata-san was president. While some of the investors may have been unhappy with his decisions for the company, the employees respected and loved him a lot. Unlike previous presidents he was personally a lover of video games, and had worked on many games himself as a software engineer. There aren't a lot of game companies whose president is a software engineer him/herself and I was proud of that fact.

I saw him up close once, when he came to NOA for an event promoting Wii Sports internally. He jogged in the room to some energy-infused music (might've been the Rocky theme?), pumping his fists high in the air along with the Wii Remote and nunchuk that he held. He got up in front of everyone and boxed against Reggie (the NOA president--I think he had just recently been appointed to the position) in Wii Boxing while a jam-packed room of employees cheered him on. I don't remember the exact outcome, but I think Iwata-san won best 2 out of 3. He was a genuine, fun, and nice guy, and Nintendo will be hard-pressed to find another leader like him.

Sometimes misunderstood yet still a brilliant man. As someone who grew up playing NES it's sad to see a company still selling canned nostalgia lose such a recognised face. 
Hell, with all these Directs and such I've felt that Iwata and Reggie were bigger mascots to the company than Mario.

One of his last messages to the public was regarding E3 2015 and Nintendo. He personally apologized for the showing if it had disappointed anyone. That's the connection he had with us. Considering Nintendo, while yes we may have criticisms of them, it was impossible that the company could ever hurt us, especially with a man like that.

Who gives a shit what he said about Hillary? Later in the interview he said that the US government wouldn't hesitate to kill journalists. Is this a thinly veiled reference to Michael Hastings and Danny Casolaro?

>Questioned as to whether he really believed the Obama administration would have journalists such as Glenn Greenwald or the Washington Post’s Barton Gellman killed for reporting on NSA leaks, as Snowden previously suggested in a 2014 interview with the Guardian, the former NSA contractor replied: “Certainly not in a way that would not be deniable.”

81
4831 :: Edward Snowden says Hillary Clinton 'ridiculous' to think emails were...
What this proves is that Snowden is just as unaware of the actual issues surrounding Clinton's e-mail server as most Redditors.

Hillary Clinton did not send classified e-mails through her private server. She did not receive e-mails marked classified through her private server. E-mails were sent to her by staff that later were determined to have classified information.

Moreover, if those later classified e-mails had been sent to her at her @state.gov address, that would be no less a violation because e-mail is not secure so you're not allowed to send classified information via e-mail.

Full text:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk just announced the most Tesla thing ever: a "Ludicrous Speed" upgrade for the top-of-the-line P85D Model S electric sedan that improves 0-60 time by 10 percent — it's down to 2.8 seconds, with a quarter-mile sprint coming in just 10.9 seconds. Tesla also promises a run to 155 miles per hour some 20 percent faster than on a standard P85D. In follow-up questions, Musk said that the upcoming Model X would also have Ludicrous Speed as an option, but due to the vehicle's weight — it's 10 percent heavier than the S — it'll likely be a bit less quick.

Ludicrous Speed doesn't come cheap, though: it's a $10,000 option for the car, so you really need to want to be pressed into the back of your seat. Musk describes the acceleration as "faster than falling," which is true — with the accelerator mashed to the floor, you're getting 1.1 G of force.

The hold music before today's press conference call was a single Ludacris song on loop, which now makes a lot of sense. There weren't any direct references to Spaceballs, but Musk is known for his sense of humor: the Model S's radio volume goes to 11, for instance.

My grandma had her license revoked by the state, that might not be the best comparison, most older drivers are terrors on the road.  A better comparison would be "Google cars drive like a drug mule trying not to get pulled over". Well more accurate, Google might not think it's better.

When I get a self-driving car, I'm not getting it for the handling, acceleration, or speed.  I'm getting it to drive me through my 90 minute commute while I work, read, or sleep.  The less jerky the better.

Edit:  Holy balls!  If I had only known what my inclusion of 'jerky' would have done...

4820 :: Google cars drive like your grandma - they're never the first off the...
It's because it can't predict what other drivers will do.  Car companies are working on ways for cars to talk to each other.  In theory if everyone had a self driving car and they all talked to each other you could coordinate things like acceleration.  Imagine if a light turned green and every car waiting started moving at once.  Also if everyone was riding in self driving cars you could increase the speed limit.  The car can react faster than a human so why not?

But that is a ways off.  They're working on a way for both self driving and regular cars to talk as well. This way a self driving or regular car would get a warning about what cars ahead of it are doing, ex. if the anti collision system in the car 3 cars ahead sees a dog run in the road and breaks, it lets the other cars know there's a dog in the road and they're breaking.  It's gonna be a  while but once better safety systems come online I bet they start driving better.  Not to mention in some states it's illegal to impede the flow of traffic, meaning if everyone is going 70mph in a 60mph zone, you can get a ticket for not going 70mph.  So the self driving car needs to follow all the traffic laws including breaking the speed limit if need be.

I hate grandma drivers (not actual grandmas). But if everyone is doing this, then I don't have to worry about stupid people. 

I'd much rather have a comfortable safe drive to work, then the constant slamming on brakes that happens every other day.

I love driving my sports car, but I would be happy to have it just for a track if thats how society changed. My life and everyone elses is too important. 

Also, as the technology improves the speeds will get faster. 

I also don't think being first off the line and not accelerating quickly is a grandma thing.. really every driver should be doing those. Take a moment before pulling off.

This whole thing has been a huge circus.

The phone was a work phone. The couple completely destroyed their personal phones to the point nothing could be recovered. They obviously knew what they were doing to cover their tracks. If that phone had something worth having on it, they would of destroyed it too. 

The FBI has wasted their time and pretty much used this as a way to get apple to hand them over the keys to all iphones.

4819 :: Drivers are being idiots with Tesla’s new autopilot features
Tesla is actually hitting a problem that is quite common when you automate things.  Instead of being a driver you are now are just monitoring the driving.  Monitoring is way more boring and seems to require less attention, when in-fact it requires a very similar amount of attention.  Except now it is boring because you are watching a computer drive the car instead of you doing the driving.  

It is like you playing a video game or watching someone else play a video game, or even worse watching an AI play a video game.  Watching someone else do it is excruciatingly boring and it is understandably easy to get distracted.

Driver assists make drivers complacent. We need fully-, not partly- or even mostly-autonomous cars.

>Now, my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low,so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack, pulls out his laptop, puts it on the seat, goes in the back again, digs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone, futzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone. Sure enough, the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway. Right? Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right?**The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get. So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need.**

4819 :: Drivers are being idiots with Tesla’s new autopilot features
They feature never should have been released in it's current state.

Google's cars are approaching a million miles driven without their autopilot causing an accident. They're testing cars around their campus that don't even have steering wheels, because their cars genuinely don't need them. [Their technology is fucking nuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9Ij0INX0). If you're interested in this subject and haven't seen Google's presentation about how their cars work, it's must-see.

Among other sensors, Google uses a very expensive LIDAR system to [map it's surroundings in 3D out to 100 meters](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/googlecar04.gif) and compare with an internal database of known road geometry accurate to centimeters. It doesn't just follow lanes, it can drive through busy downtown streets, cope with foot traffic, handle 4 way intersections with pushy drivers, etc.

This is the *baseline* level of tech that should be required before before a driver lets a computer take control of the steering wheel. In part because Google has found that once you relinquish some control to the car, people simply don't pay enough attention.

Tesla's car, by comparison, is practically driving blind. The idea that while the computer drives, you should have your hands on the wheel paying close attention, ready to ready to react in an instant should anything go wrong, completely defeats the purpose of having such a system.

All it takes is a few accidents and this shit is going to hit with a legislation hammer so hard we won't see self driving cars again until 2050. So Tesla should have waited.

172
4819 :: Drivers are being idiots with Tesla’s new autopilot features
Until cars are 100% ready to drive themselves, they should not be driving themselves. And "autopilot" sounds like "driving itself" to me and to most people. I'm gonna say this one's on Tesla. It doesn't matter how much fine print you give them, it's the general public you're talking about, you can't give it a name like that and expect people to understand further than what the name implies. 

They should have called it "advanced cruise control" or some shit because that's what it is.  Just hope this won't set back the public opinion of autonomous cars.

Edit: people seem to be missing the point, the technology is great and should be released, but it's a very serious matter and Tesla just threw it out there with a misleading name and expected everybody to figure out the details.

The most interesting section in the article to me.  Seems like there  could be a relatively simple solution to this issue.  Especially considering the paragraph before this quote mentions companies complaining about a lack of skilled engineers.

4817 :: U.S. Predicts Zero Job Growth For Electrical Engineers: "IEEE-USA sai...
This article is leaving out a huge detail. I focused my studies on power systems (a subset of EEE) and its true that there may not be huge growth but the average age of a power systems engineer is almost 55 - many of whom will be retiring in 10-20 years. The same is true for several other branches of electrical engineering. I went to state school and dont know anyone who didnt get a job within 1-3 months of graduating (I graduated in May) and most had jobs already lined up. Look at unemployment rates. The world will always need engineers.

The big lie of a ["STEM Shortage"](http://www.cringely.com/2015/06/15/the-h-1b-visa-program-is-a-scam/) has been annoying as fuck for at least the last two to three years.

Disclaimer: I have no problem with skilled immigrants. I've known great engineers from every country in the world (okay, I'm exaggerating only slightly). What I have no tolerance for is lying, scumbag companies that intentionally perpetuate a set of assertions they know damn well are completely false, in the name of fucking over highly skilled and talented workers from one specific country.

4817 :: U.S. Predicts Zero Job Growth For Electrical Engineers: "IEEE-USA sai...
This is anecdotal, but I'd love to hear from others. My perspective is from the integrated circuit industry. 

1. EE is a difficult field. From circuit design, device physics, to signal theory. Many people look to get OUT. I generally see these people go for their MBAs or switch into CS. This brings me to point 2.


2. It seems there so few Americans in EE grad school. Are the applications low, are grad schools accepting more international students? I simply don't know.

4817 :: U.S. Predicts Zero Job Growth For Electrical Engineers: "IEEE-USA sai...
Damn this is scary. I'm a senior with one internship in analog testing. Ive applied to grad schools and just finished that fiasco which was stressful and Im pretty discouraged since I had a sub 3.5 and no pubs. I want to be an analog design engineer, but all the jobs are mostly masters minimum and the top 20 programs are as expteced really hard to get into. 

Reading this is even more discouraging. I chose this degree primarily because of the job security and thought the struggles Ive had were worth some end goal. I guess that was pretty foolish as Im about to find out after graduation. I've been fairly depressed as it is.

4817 :: U.S. Predicts Zero Job Growth For Electrical Engineers: "IEEE-USA sai...
EE is getting commodified and deskilled because what's the need for a multitude of different circuit designs when you can just make one generic thing that can be programmed to do whatever in software.

It's part of why I'm considering leaving the field. It's boring now--everyone makes something that "does everything, except cheaper/faster/with less power". All of the interesting end-user products are interesting because of their software, not their hardware.

The only somewhat exciting sub-fields left are RF and power, and both of those are in danger of being software-ified as well.

(also, a lot of jobs are moving to asia since that's where everything's made anyway, there's an advantage in being close to production, and education in engineering is on the rise over there)

**I forgot about devices work: process improvements are still important for obvious reasons, but most EEs don't specialize in that. In fact I'd expect they hire more physics and chemistry majors than EEs, probably more advanced degrees too**

I find this funny as the ISPs that are also content producers have done this to themselves.  Google did a neat experiment where they proved it was much faster for everyone if someone can connect, grab the whole file they need as fast as possible and then disconnect, instead of slowly streaming it over time.

The content holders however would shit a metric shit ton of bricks if we allowed the whole show to be loaded onto the viewers system at once. So instead we keep 200 000+ connections live at a time and re download all the same information over and over with re watching.  Through their anal copywrong trolling they've created the very scenario they complain about on their networks.

I understand that on one level this is interesting information.  And interesting/important for industry analysis, market trends, societal trends, etc.


But I also don't give a fuck.  All this is showing is how end users are *choosing* to use *their* internet access.


Stats like this are often used tro attack net neutrality.  They are often twisted to justify positions that Netflix or Amazon Prime or Google should have to pay additional fees to ISP to get to the users.  Or that users should have to pay extra to get normal bandwidth for those sites.  All those sites (Netflix, etc.) already pay lots of money for their access to the internet.  As do you.  Any proposal as a result of these stats that someone in the chain should have to pay yet more is twisted logic.


How end users decide to use their bandwidth is nobodies business.  ISP should just be "dumb" pipes from the end user POV and provide the best bandwidth possible.  (Yes this is over simplified to make a point.)
203

Oh boy, I hope the increasing number of statements from tech moguls (Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Whatsapp's Jan Koum, to name several) really gets the attention of government officials. In a country that is ranked [near the bottom in STEM,](https://www.nms.org/AboutNMSI/TheSTEMCrisis.aspx) having the technology industry speak out only places more importance on their words. If the United States seeks to improve its position among other countries in technology, it is *imperative* that we protect the digital rights of citizens. 
594
4812 :: Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, sides with Tim Cook response to US court o...
To be honest, I was hoping for a much stronger statement from Google :/

Edit: since my comment is so high up I'll clarify exactly what was disappointing to me about Sundar's statement. The emphasis is mine.

>**Important** post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking **could** compromise users’ privacy.

He call's Tim Cook's post "important" and says such forced hacking "could" compromise users' privacy. This is a very weak statement. He stops short of agreeing with what Cook said, only labeling it important, instead of correct.

>We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that’s wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. **Could** be a troubling precedent.

Could it? **Could it?** Come on, Sundar. This is bad. Call it bad.

>Looking forward to a thoughtful and open discussion on this important issue.

Give me a break. This is meaningless.

Frankly, it's impossible to tell whether Sundar even sides with Tim Cook or the FBI because of the way the statement is phrased. I think headlines claiming "Google takes Apple's Side" are jumping the gun. The statement is as wishy-washy as it possibly could have been.

>We at Google value our users' privacy and cherish the trust they have placed in us to watch over their personal information. We stand firmly with Apple in their opposition to the FBI's unprecedented actions in this case.

That's more what I and others were hoping to hear!

They don't understand breaking into one phone is creating an operating system that can break into all phones. It is the Pandora's box. It is a lack of understanding of technology and not listening to Apple's explanations.

Hardly a strong response. "Could" compromise privacy. "Could be" a dangerous precedent. How about "would" and "is"?

Not to mention the hypocrisy considering that the FBI wouldn't need to backdoor a potential terrorist's Android given that the overwhelming majority are unencrypted.

Google bowing to OEMs pressure and backtracking on their decision to make encryption a mandatory requirement in Lollipop, finally enabling it (with loopholes) in Marshmallow (currently a whopping 1% penetration) and shipping flagship devices in which NAND speeds plummet when encryption is enabled -- to the point where prominent Android publications recommend you leave it disabled -- shows you they don't really give a shit.

Would a cop be able to let people go for minor crimes anymore? Or would they only access the videos if they had to for a court case or something?

16 year veteran.

16 years means he would have been heavily vested in the company and likely worth millions at this point.

I would presume this is entirely unrelated to the project and more related to the fact that he simply wants to enjoy life and retire.

4797 :: IPv6 celebrates its 20th birthday by reaching 10 percent deployment
It's definitely an improvement, but for network engineers it's been both a battle of interoperability, and a battle of stability. Often it's a battle of cost, having to replace antiquated core, edge, and CPE equipment. I am glad to see wider adoption of IPv6, although adoption especially on the consumer end has been slower than many would like. On the enterprise end, adoption delays has been due to security concerns and stability concerns.

We'll get there. Someday. It's like killing off Windows XP.

118
4797 :: IPv6 celebrates its 20th birthday by reaching 10 percent deployment
The two key things that have caused slow IPv6 adoption (at least in ISPs) are: 

1. There was no reason to roll it out until the addresses ran out. Do you deploy a massive change to your network that will have zero customer impact (if it works) or do you deploy other network changes that will provide revenue, stability, or some other benefit?

2. Every function of every part of your network needs to support IPv6 at scale in the mode you're using it at. All ISPs networks are different, and your ISP might be the only one using that piece of kit in that way and now it needs to do the same with IPv6. Also, since IPv6 wasn't a priority when you built the network (see point 1) while you might have said you wanted it during the procurement process (since the network designers were expecting to need it soon), no one actually tested it beyond maybe a quick functional test as a part of the procurement process.

Well, IP makes the allowance. IPv4 doesn't. That's why you *can* run dual IPv6 and IPv4 stacks. It's not a failure of IPv4 to support only 32-bit addresses, it's a design feature. The IP stack is working exactly as specified. And if IPv4 allowed specification of arbitrary addresses, you'd still lose all the other stuff IPv6 supports that IPv4 doesn't.

It should be remembered that many tech companies have blanket gag orders on them preventing them from sharing info they would prefer to. There are many cases where companies like Google have [spend a lot of resources trying to fight gag orders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/google-says-it-fought-gag-orders-in-wikileaks-investigation/2015/01/28/e62bfd04-a5c9-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html), etc.

Neither does your phone company or the post office. Would render many investigations impossible. Should we require police to tell suspects they are staked out?

The issue is the use of National Security Letters and not requiring warrants to start these taps in many cases.

Everyone should install [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) for their calls and messages. Works on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8), there's also a Chrome/Chromium addon that's in beta. And it's free software (GPLv3).

It's sort of like iMessage for Android. The app also handles sms so it doesn't feel like a separate app, even if none of your friends have it today there's no reason not to keep it installed. iOS doesn't let other apps handle sms though so it just sends encrypted messages.

And in roughly ten years, you could almost no longer imagine living without them. Tcp/ip is the biggest invention for the internet, but the killer applications like the web and e-mail were instrumental in its success and adoption.

4757 :: The first website went online 25 years ago today
A couple of years ago I found a Next cube. I'm not going to say where it is to avoid vandalism, but this is the story.

The cube was more or less abandoned and I asked the owner if I could play with it. He was very reticent but I was more relentless and I got to play with it. He told me that Next computer belonged, at one point, to CERN and that it has not been used since then. I decided to explore it.

The first interesting thing I found was a file containing a lot of email addresses from people that seemed to work at CERN or be related to CERN in some form or fashion. The owner of the computer decided to be overly professional and deleted the file.

The second interesting thing I found completely blew my mind. There was a folder called WorldWideWeb and inside it several files called WorldWideWeb_0.1.0.tar, 0.1.1.tar, 0.2.0.tar and so on. Could this be? I opened one by one and indeed they were apps. I started with the oldest and executed them one by one.

The first one raised an error as it tried to contact cernvax.cern.ch (this Next cube was disconnected) and then it crashed: http://imgur.com/e90mCeM

I kept on going and eventually one started. It was very plain but I knew what it was. I quickly went back to my terminal, open vi, and wrote a small HTML file, which then I passed as a parameter to the little WorldWideWeb_0.2. It worked... **it displayed an h1 as a title!**.

I was jumping out of my skin. I don't want to publish the whole picture to avoid releasing private information, but I'm standing, next to the cube, pointing and what could possible be the earliest version of the web browser that still works today, displaying a web site I just coded: http://imgur.com/7efjrHT Then I discovered the browser allowed me to edit the page, directly there, without having to do anything special, and I remembered that Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally designed the web to be read-write, not read-only.

That was one of the most exciting moments of my life. When I got home I wrote an email to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, telling him of my finding and where he could find that computer, just in case he wanted to get ahold of those binaries (I couldn't find any source code anywhere on that machine). He never replied, I don't know if he ever got my email. I bet he gets a lot of it and that he's a very busy man.

**Update**: I turned this comment into a blog post. It's been on my to-do list for ages to write down my experience. Thank you Reddit for pushing me to do it: http://pupeno.com/2015/12/21/how-i-found-one-of-the-earliest-browsers-in-history/

>Sourceforge hosts ~440,000 projects dating back to 1999; It seems to have been the default option to host software projects for a decade or so. Many / most of those projects have been abandoned by their maintainers, and the official websites of those projects have been taken down, as continued webhosting and domain registration costs money, and a project abandoned a decade ago usually isn't judged to be worth ongoing expenses.

>In tens of thousands of cases, Sourceforge and its mirrors are the only remaining repository for applications that at one point had, or even continue to have a significant userbase. The fact that they have begun this poisonous practice of adware & malware bundling indicates they're probably not long for this world, and that means the abandoned projects Sourceforge hosts, are threatened. If Sourceforge goes down under present conditions and all the mirrors have dropped out as per the request here: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/38ebj4/dont_like_whats_happening_with_sourceforge/ , digital historians are losing access to a substantial number of entire programming languages, and the ability to read many thousands of file formats of varying obscurity, forever.

I would agree that the internet is not a basic human right. You can survive without it (like many did less than 20 years ago). It makes life easier, but not a requirement (my grandparents do swimmingly well without it).

That being said, I think *it is* in our best interest as a society to ensure that we make public access available as broadly as we can.

4751 :: ​Republican FCC Commissioner: You Don’t Need the Internet — "O’Rielly...
I mean, its true right?  
It's only been common for about 15 years.  
Rights are literally innate. Things that have always been. Not things that are nice to have.  
People argue about rights because some people talk about them from a philosophical perspective (libertarians, some repubs), and a 'we want to have this' perspective (progressives). Right does not mean you can just have it, it means the gov can't take it away...

Apple seems to forget that most users aren't designers requiring the latest in CPU or GPU performance. 

I've got an iMac and MBP that are from 2011, I see no need to upgrade in the near future. 

This is just marketing from Apple though. Of course they want to sell you a new system more than every five years.

How the hell would she know? For two months classified and sensitive emails were sent entirely in the clear. There was nothing TO breach. And for the rest of the time, it's not like Russia or China is going to put a text file on the server saying "Hahaha!", like they are from Anonymous.

Hillary Clinton got caught not properly saving records in violation of federal law.  AFTER she got caught violating the records retention law she proceeded to DELETE 30,000 messages.  Then to be a smart ass the submitted the remaining messages on PAPER.  She then attempted to delete entire contents of her secret server.   Her little print to paper smart ass trick must have bought her about a day and a half while some poor clerks ran the paper through a scanner and OCR software to recreate the electronic database of messages.

The Nissan Leaf has changed my life. Bought a used 2013 with the more efficient heater and only 13k miles for ten grand with the battery still at full health.

Absolutely incredible thing to own, I can recharge for free in 30 mins at dealerships and the only expenses seem to be registration, insurance and a new pair of tires/brakes from time to time. I drive so much more now that I don't have to worry about gas or wear. I recommend one to anyone that can live within the range limit between charges, and I don't even live somewhere with a particularly large amount of chargers.

So cheap, so economical to own and just a fantastic thing to have.

4736 :: Elon Musk - "We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If ...
The way I heard it, Tesla has a cultural problem in the software department and good people are leaving.

Musk portrays it as losers washing out to work at other companies.

I guess there are two sides to every story.
1813
4736 :: Elon Musk - "We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If ...
Maybe people fail to "make it at Tesla" by asking for market rate compensation and reasonable work/life balance, since last time I heard they are still underpaying their employees and they require minimal 50 hours a week, with 70-80 being the norm. Elon Musk was pretty [proud](http://www.autoblog.com/2012/09/07/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-q-and-a/) of it in his own interview.

EDIT: Literally only [67%](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/tesla-reviews-SRCH_KE0,5.htm) of Tesla employees would recommend the company to their friends, this vs Google's 91%, Facebook's 90%, Apple and Microsoft's 82%, even Cisco/Nvidia rank higher. Hell, even [EA](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/ea-reviews-SRCH_KE0,2.htm) has a 78% rate.

EDIT 2: I am not trying to criticize Tesla's company culture. I do think the company is doing some amazing things and it's understandable that they can be stressful, and obviously it's not for everyone. However my biggest gripe was when Mr.Musk (who I hold a lot of respect for) paints his ex-employees in a less than favorable picture just because they decided to leave for a competitor.

4736 :: Elon Musk - "We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If ...
Even disregard the veracity of that statement, the very fact that the CEO of a major public company trash talks his former employees just because they jump ship is extremely unbefitting of his position. This also further discourages talents from joining Tesla since they are just going to think "oh, if I leave Tesla they are just gonna say all sorts of bad things about me in the future".

Tesla already has a less than ideal reputation when it comes to how they treat their employees, this makes Elon Musk seem insecure about their ability to retain top talents.

4727 :: How DuPont Concealed the Dangers of the New Teflon Toxin | Chemical c...
The New York Times has an article that talks about the lawyer that picked up the case of C8 against DuPont. It's an interesting read that predates the use of "confidential business information." 

"DuPond did supply 110,000 pages of studies and research to his office, some dating back 50 years." Given today's computer systems to handle information like this the CBI claim system would avoid this all-together (IANAL).

[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?_r=0](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html?_r=0)

It isn't Teflon itself that's the toxic chemical, its a precursor chemical that is toxic and problematic. Teflon is only dangerous if you heat it up to extreme temperatures, and it decomposes, even then it's only a hazard if you breathe it in. 

DuPonts behaviour is the real problem here, they willfully concealed the harmfulness of C8, and because the EPA is mostly powerless to ban chemicals they got away with it. 
498

They also try to stop anybody from saying anything. My company once published an article about the dangers of teflon... within days Dupont sent a C&D order to remove all mentions of 'Teflon' because it's a trademark. We had to change the name of 'teflon' to Polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE, which effectively killed the article as nobody Googles for 'is Polytetrafluoroethylene safe?' or 'dangers of Polytetrafluoroethylene'.

4727 :: How DuPont Concealed the Dangers of the New Teflon Toxin | Chemical c...
Chemist here. The discussion of this article, evidenced by many of the comments, suffers from confusion about what *Teflon™*, PTFE, and PFOA are. First, we're not talking about a single chemical with Teflon: it's a brand. The relevant chemicals/substance that concern is here are:

* [PFOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid), a.K.a "C8", a small molecule acid and [perfluorinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorinated_carboxylic_acid) (all H's on the hydrocarbon are replaced by F's) [surfactant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) — which is like soap. It's closely related to [Scotchgard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotchgard), which was phased out by 3M for household use as a result of several concerns. As i understand, it's used industrially n the production of PTFE (which in and of itself is not a problem). The question here seems to be the unknowns surrounding it's presence — or the chemicals that may have replaced it — in water streams entering into the environment.
* [PTFE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) — polytetrafluoroethylene, a plastic widely used, although largely invisible, save for non-stick coatings. It's optical, electrical, and chemical properties make it independents to modern science and industry, along with other related [fluoropolymers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoropolymer).
* [Teflon™](https://www.chemours.com/Teflon/en_US/) is a brand and trademark. Hence it can refer to a variety of materials, each with different applications and compositions, hence although it is in some just PTFE made by a particular company, it's not necessarily identical. 

So we have some terms that The Intercept and those in this discussion need to use with greater care. To be fair, it can be confusing, but these are important distinctions. 

It's also easy to see industry and those who work with them as the "bad guys" however in my experience with industry scientists, they have far greater concerns in the area of safety than your average member of the public.

4727 :: Denmark Just Set a Wind Power Record...Again | According to Energinet...
In Scotland, we store surplus power (e.g. produced by wind turbines) by having it power pumps to pump water up-river, behind hydro-electric dams. When there's a deficit in power, the dams allow water down-river, powering the dam and producing hydro-power. These two things essentially turn the lochs of Scotland into enormous batteries.

Denmark's a lot flatter than Scotland though, and I presume that means it has a vastly reduced capacity for storing its surplus electricity as hydro-power. How is the surplus energy produced by the wind turbines stored there?
275
4727 :: Denmark Just Set a Wind Power Record...Again | According to Energinet...
One thing I'm curious about with these kinds of numbers is how you deal with times when there is no wind.

A big argument in America is not that there's anything wrong with alternative energy, but rather that it's incredibly difficult to maintain an even flow of power on the line, given that wind and solar comes and goes at irregular intervals and battery tech really isn't at a place where we can store enough excess.

So how do other countries deal with this problem when their alt generation is so high?

Companies in my home state of NJ were poised to build several wind turbines, to eventually number in the hundreds, a couple miles offshore. Time and time again the state shot them down; everything from environmental impact concernd to not willing to invest in "unproven" tech. It has been 5 years, and only just recently has ground been broken **on shore**.

Look, I'm the first to say that (with current tech) wind and solar will never be able to meet our power demands; they can only lessen the need for fossil fuels, not replace them. And I can accept that... at least until fusion power is viable. But with roughly **90000** miles of coastline, it seems to me the US is just leaving a great supplemental power source - even greater if you count tidal power - untapped.

I hate this type of headline.

No they don't.  At least 11% of people don't know what HTML is (although you could also include the people who wrote this article and thought it was a programming language).  However I guarantee they don't "think it's a Sexually Transmitted Disease".  They chose it in a multiple choice question in a survey because they didn't know what it was and guessed wrong.  They don't "think" it.  I guarantee no thought was involved.  They will not wake up in the morning "thinking" this, nor go to sleep with anything approaching this thought going through their mind.  They just ticked a box/circled an answer.  

You usually get this kind of headline with children, which is even worse e.g. '10% of 5 year olds think Europe is a type of sandwich filling' or something equally nonsensical.  No.  Someone put that as an option in a multiple choice question, and if something is one of the few options in a multiple choice question, it's inevitable that some people are going to choose it because they have no clue/can't read/don't care and are guessing.  That does not mean they actually 'think' it, in the sense of "I used to think the moon was made of cheese" which would imply you actually hold a meaningful but wrong idea in your mind which you visualise every time someone mentions the moon.

A few key points for those that don't read articles and come straight to the comments:

* This is a survey of roughly 2,400 Americans aged 18 and over, no specification is given as to the demographic of the survey.

* 23% thought an “MP3” was a “Star Wars” robot. It is actually an audio ~~file~~ format. 

* 18% identified “Blu-ray” as a marine animal. It is a disc format typically used to store high-definition videos.

* 15% said they believed “software” is comfortable clothing. Software is a general term for computer programs.

* 12% said “USB” is the acronym for a European country. In fact, USB is a type of data transfer protocol and commonly referred to as a connector.

I'd take this "statistic" with a pinch of salt, but it is still impressive that such a large proportion of any group of people are so ignorant of basic technological terms.

Welcome to the 5th annual "misconstruing the terms of service" conference. 
70
4722 :: There Are Some Super Shady Things in Oculus Rift's Terms of Service
This isn't new.  Not at all.  Websites and companies have been using standard disclaimers like that for decades.

But let's sensationalize it now, because reasons.

Edit:  For those uninitiated, most websites and companies uses these types of "catch-all" terms of service.  They have for decades, and I sure did as well back in the 90's when I ran several large websites.  I used nearly identical wording as well.  A lot of this "we own your creations" legalese isn't to take your creations away, but to prevent people from suing a website that hosts your content (most of which I couldn't give a damn about anyway) because people are always looking to sue the deep pocket companies.  

Now Facebook has it's own set of issues, but this appears to be pretty par for the course.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you found hundreds of thousands of other websites using nearly identical language in their TOS, none of which have anything to do with Facebook or VR.
281
4722 :: There Are Some Super Shady Things in Oculus Rift's Terms of Service
Nearly any distribution platform has those terms because otherwise they can't distribute content. 

But these seem especially broad.
75
4722 :: There Are Some Super Shady Things in Oculus Rift's Terms of Service
I'd like to remind you that if you are USING THE INTERNET you likely agree to these terms via lots of sites.

E.g. Reddit for Example
https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy

Now there is 2 things in the article mentioned, a Privacy Policy, and a Content Policy.

The Content Policy is the handing of rights over to a 3rd party service. This is common and basically required because everything you write is copyright and a 3rd party is not allowed to republish. This establishes a license for the publisher for your content. They need it in order to serve it back up to other people. Could it be more strict? definitely, however it's in their interest to be vague because who knows what they might want to do and not get sued in the future. Technology changes and there is lots of things they might want to do without fear of getting sued for using user-submitted content in various ways. Other services have very similar policies, e.g. Instagram being a big one. 

As for privacy policies, it's all standard fare. Reddit's is similar, get off the fucking interwebs if you don't like it. It's a fact of life now and all of the big boys have similar policies. Analytics are mainstream and you can't succeed without it. It makes marketing/advertising several orders of magnitudes more profitable (e.g. you can locally advertise, which is beneficial to the advertiser and consumer). It also gives companies insights into how their software and services are used so they can effectively improve it. They do this for you, to make a better, more intelligent, adaptive product.

4722 :: There Are Some Super Shady Things in Oculus Rift's Terms of Service
Does the HTC Vive do this as well? If it doesn't then I know who I'm buying VR from.

Edit: so apparently this is so they can use your the data you uploaded using their services and distribute it e.g. you create a VR environment and want others to see it this allows Oculus to distribute it. Reminds me of the Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods with user created content.
17
4722 :: There Are Some Super Shady Things in Oculus Rift's Terms of Service
> If you create something with the Rift, the Terms of Service say that you surrender all rights to that work and that Oculus can use it whenever it wants, for whatever purposes:

Seems like something completely different than what the TOS actually says: 

> By submitting User Content through the Services, you grant Oculus a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual (i.e. lasting forever), non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e. we can grant this right to others) right to use, copy, display, store, adapt, publicly perform and distribute such User Content in connection with the Services.

Doesn't "through the Services" mean something completely different than "created with the Rift"? This is likely just in reference to you uploading stuff to the Oculus Home platform.

The TPP isn't inherently evil but it is a tool that will serve those with resources.

They say China will write their own agreement and the US will be financially isolated if it fails.

The worlds wealth is controlled primarily by a few hundred people.

Who knows if those in power are all in cahoots.

The idea behind deals like this is to obstruct those who impede progress without impairing those who work for progress to as significant a degree. IP is kind of 50/50 in this respect with all the patent trolls and the massive inequality of wealth.

Imagine how hard it would be to make copied food illegal. If we all had free food, we would tell all the creators of the food that we copy that we really apprieciated that they made it, but that they should really rethink their profession as its now pretty foolish to think you can make money selling food. new food would still be created by people who care about the art of food and not the profit. These food artists would give the world wonderful new dishes to copy for free and make money through their noteriety, Artists would be commissioned to make new dishes by rich food lovers too.

4709 :: Turkey bans Reddit under Internet censorship law
Turk here, I am hearing this from reddit. This is just an ordinary ban. Only thing to do is change DNS. Since porn is blocked in Turkey, people have already changed their DNSs so no one would notice. 

The thing is Imgur is already banned here. This makes most of nsfw content on reddit unreachable. Why did they ban reddit I have no clue..

There are more advanced bans too, for example we cant reach porn.com , xvideos , pornhub and some other big porn sites even when we change DNS. 

Although I will miss checking Reddit outdoors. We have seen even worse bans like twitter , facebook or youtube. Apps you meant to use outdors. 

--Edit:--

(Clarification: Twitter, Facebook and Youtube are not banned right now. And also I don't find this normal or acceptable. You can read my other comments below to get into details.)

He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap. My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go. Let them worship as they will; every man can follow his own conscience, provided it does not interfere with sane reason or bid him against the liberty of his fellow-men.

I live in Turkey and I heart about Reddit ban here. In Turkey, the biggest and the most successful universities have a a different ISP called ULAKBIM, which is an academic network and it seems there is no Reddit ban on ULAKBIM. Imgur also is not banned on ULAKBIM.

On the other hand, I see lots of people starting using VPN since Gezi movement. This is no longer about being able to accessing a particular website, but about putting a distance between ourself and sick politics of Turkey government. It feels extremely uncomfortable for the young citizens of Turkey, whenever something happened in country, Facebook and Twitter bandwiths are reduced or sites are banned. 

For me, this is huge. In any place where information is not accessible, you become unable to hear, unable to think and unable to act..

Yeah, we Turks are immune to these blocks, thanks to DNS modifications, many VPNs and the zenmate extension for chrome. A lot of people don't even realize it is blocked. 

Having said that, the reddit ban is especially disturbing because reddit is not even widely used in Turkey (yet). So, even a website with a relatively small audience hits the radar of the censorship and that is very alarming.

I read the headline, looked away to do something else, then looked back, reminding myself, that this is a big fucking deal. Turkey is one of the most western, secular Muslim-majority states in the region, and right now one of their largest political issues is how they are dealing with the Kurds, a very secular and progressive group of Muslims who are the U.S.'s main allies in Iraq and Syria.   

Let's not turn a blind eye to this huge western population in Turkey that is being punished because of the whims of a few people in power.  

I highly doubt this is the will of most Turkish citizens.

Yep, we had a somewhat similar issue in Canada with one of the big carriers, Bell. It was a bit different and Bell probably fell more clearly on the wrong side of the law because it was their own video service where they didn't charge for data usage so not only did it create a competitive disadvantage for other video streaming services but it specifically benefitted Bell's own video streaming service and not outside services like with T-Mobile. End of the day though I'm not sure that makes much difference, it is still anti-competitive and gives the partners that T-Mobile has agreements with an advantage over those that don't have a deal with them to be included in the agreement. 

As for that case, Bell lost and they do now have to charge bandwidth used on their streaming service towards your data plan. They did state that they would appeal it and I have not heard anything on the matter since. That was probably about 6 months ago.

If T-Mobile's policy is that only major, established video streaming sites can be included in BingeOn, that seems like it clearly goes against the principles of Net Neutrality. But if their policy is that any streaming video site can ask to be included, what's the issue?

If I want to start a Netflix competitor and I'm not on BingeOn because T-Mobile doesn't think I'm a big enough company, then it makes it tougher for me to compete against Netflix. But if all I need to do is ask T-Mobile, show that I can meet some minimum technical specifications and I'm in BingeOn, that doesn't seem like it is anti-competitive.

How is it that people do not understand this simple concept? There are well over 300 million citizens in the USA. There is a much smaller number of people that are in control. That is very scary to me. They are basically exempt from all the crap they do and will reign down upon the nation. Yet 300 million people do nothing about it. Not hard to wonder why they despise the sheeple.

Who do we send messages to, who do we tell that we're not OK with this?

"Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – The bill contains $315 million for the FCC – a cut of $25 million below the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $73 million below the request. The legislation prohibits the FCC from implementing net neutrality until certain court cases are resolved, requires newly proposed regulations to be made publicly available for 21 days before the Commission votes on them, and prohibits the FCC from regulating rates for either wireline or wireless Internet service."

4699 :: The GOP Is Trying to Nuke Net Neutrality With a Budget Bill Sneak Attack
Net Neutrality is important, but look at the other cuts on that list:

- IRS: Budget slashed by $838 million. Budget cuts have caused major staff cuts and an increase in mistakes due to staff cuts. They're slashing it even further now. 

- General Services Administration: Cut by $803 million.

- SEC: No funding increase this year. 

- CPFB: Brings funding under appropriations process (this process) instead of direct federal reserve funding -- leaving it dangerously open to politics. 

- CPSC: $1 million cut. 

- FTC: $9 million cut. 

This isn't an assault on Net Neutrality... this is a full-on assault of our rights. The SEC, CPFB, CPSC and the FTC are the most basic departments that protect our rights as consumers and republicans are defunding all of them.

We should not constantly be trying to stop our elected representatives from doing things that are flagrantly not in our interests.

Yet it is a non stop flood of last second panic to attempt to stop them day in and day out, only brought to our collective attention by the hard work and research of an industrious few.

These people need to be stopped. They need to be removed. This "system" is not stopping them, nor is voting. We cannot affect meaningful change while they maintain a monopoly on our government. When is it going to be enough? Enough of their self serving willful ignorance of the responsibilities of their position, the legacy and well being of our country, and the best interests of the people they have taken oaths to serve. 

If I went to my job and told my boss to fuck off I'm doing what I want for the personal interests of myself and my friends, I would be fired on the spot. That's the sort of business mantra they like to espouse so often, they should be held to the same.

Do Republican voters support killing net neutrality? And if so, is it because they're against it or because they don't really understand it ("Obamacare for the internet" types)?

I know I'm not being very open minded, but from a consumer standpoint what Comcast and others want to be able to do is pretty shitty. We could easily end up with an even slower, less reliable system that looks a lot like cable and satellite TV - different services for different packages from different suppliers. It's not hyperbolic to say it could create a drastically different internet if the ISPs aren't kept in check.

Plus, EVERYONE hates Comcast - why support a stance on net neutrality that they are pushing?

I keep seeing this reported as if it has any bearing on whether or not the FBI was correct in trying to get access, or by extension if such action is legally warranted in the first place.

He's *technically* right. Legislating net neutrality will give the government greater leeway over regulating the internet. But that's a good thing, since we don't have 5 million competing ISPs, but rather one in an area, *maybe* two if you're lucky. So regulation is needed.

This is what you need to do-

Contact any or all of your local TV stations. Tell them you have a letter from your local politician lying to you about net neutrality, and you want to read it to them and show it to them. Tell them he is lying to and misleading the people he is supposed to represent. If any of them agree to interview you, do some research beforehand. Through foia and public records, find information showing records of his campaign contributions, as well as any lobby funds he has accepted. This is hard proof that he is lying and is following the will of the people who bought him, not the people who voted for him. Hell, maybe even put out a press release, and hold a small presser at a podium in a public area.

If anyone does do a story on this, they will likely contact the politician's people for comment, and they will likely decline to comment. This gives you a chance to publicly show what he's doing, with little to no chance for a response from his team.

This is a great story for any station that has an Investigative or Consumer Watch or an On Your Side type of franchise. I'd you were in my area, I'd take your story today

"Government control of the Internet" *also* sounds good. Because the only other realistic choice is *corporate* control of the Internet, which is what Net Neutrality is supposed to prevent. 

Corporations are completely unaccountable to the common citizens, whereas government at least in theory is made up of people that work for the citizens. 

The problem isn't government control, the problem is corporate control *of the government* which is what's going on now.

"Highly successful broadband industry" is also correct. The idea that that is what people want or need is not, though, since another way to say that is "super-expensive Internet access at speeds 200 times lower than in, say, Korea, which generates gigantic profit margins for the ISP's at the people's expense"...

The solution to this is not to trust that the government won't do it, and it isn't to elect officials who promise reform. The solution is to make it impossible, or nearly impossible, for them to do so. Encrypt your phones, use encrypted VoIP services, encrypted text messaging services, P2P messaging like Bleep (once they iron out all the kinks in their app), etc.

Trusting others will always result in someone taking advantage of someone else. Technology allows us to do things without having to trust. Let's take advantage of that.

I'm not sure how fast they were going, but to come to such an abrupt stop, the car remained impressively level (no "nosedive") 

I'm not sure if it's because of the insanely low center of gravity of that car, adaptive suspension, or a combination, but that is clearly a more quality ride than my $25k compact car.  I wish I could afford to drive a $100k car.  :-(

4682 :: Watch Tesla's autopilot stop an Uber driver's head-on collision
I have a semi-truck that can do that as its fitted with collision detection and automatic emergency braking. The problem is that it also does it when it doesn't need to, for example the vehicle in front is slowing to enter a gas station and even though I, the human, driving the truck knows the vehicle would have cleared my lane by the time I got to that point the truck's system doesn't - it just "sees" the vehicle in front slowing down, me not slowing down so it slams all on. The other trick it does is [on this bend](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.7757259,-0.9906414,3a,34.1y,300.06h,82.44t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sv_dCdWxpAO1UWrrjaG_QHg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1) where it detects those marker posts as an object it decides I'm about to run into and slams all on.

4682 :: Watch Tesla's autopilot stop an Uber driver's head-on collision
I'll offer a different perspective as a motorcyclist that has kept me wreck free for 11 years. (I've never owned a car).

First off, I'd you are driving next to a lane of stopped traffic, and you are going fast, you are asking for an accident.

The guy making the left hand turn most likely didn't realize that there was a car coming so fast when there was stopped traffic. Headlights tend to homogenize when closely packed and at night. You simply can't tell as well spatially what's going on.

Drive slow next to a lane of stopped traffic. It's as easy that! It just might save you the hassle of a wreck.

If you want to see something truly sleazy you should watch Sen. Sessions who took the podium yesterday to tell us everything we know is wrong. http://www.c-span.org/video/?326202-9/senator-sessions-nsa-surveillance

He stated the NSA doesn’t lie, even though we have film showing them flat out lying to Congress multiple times, and that Section 215 has not been misused even though it has. 

He thinks we should not worry our pretty little heads about this, just go on about our business and leave them alone so they can continue to screw us over.

He states there is nothing wrong with Section 215 of the Patriot Act or how it’s been used even though federal courts have declared it illegal. We just don’t understand it (including the federal courts).

He may as well have said “Even though we (the government) are recording your phone calls, web activity, and email no one would misuse this to manipulate the stock markets or target our political enemies. We are just too pure at heart to do such things.”

The issue is cultural. Cultural within every government, every intelligence or law enforcement branch around the world. 

Your data cannot be protected unless you protect it yourself. With encryption and chains of trust. Because even if laws are passed / unpassed that stop the collection of data, other countries or organizations will do it. It'll be done under the table, or by privateer hackers and whoever else. 

The culture doesn't respect your data or your privacy at all, and even changing that culture won't change it in hostile nations. 

It's incredibly personal and incredibly important though. With nothing more than my metadata over the last month, an intelligence agency could theoretically draw a timeline of: 

* My growing dissatisfaction within a relationship
* Considering infidelity / who else is out there
* The amicable break / time out from the relationship
* Meeting someone new
* Hitting it off big time
* Telling my friends how it went

Even without the actual content (which is obviously gathered as well), this information could all be gathered based on patterns of who I talk to, what apps I've used, etc.

I think everyone needs to ask themselves and those around them: Is this what we want the role of our government to be? Are we so terrified of some backwater cultists that we need a system that can deduce that kind of detail about each citizen's life?

Note that you are only throttled when the tower is at max capacity. Unlike other providers that throttle you down for the rest of your billing cycle.

If they didn't think people would use the service as described they shouldn't have offered it. Just another example of cash grabs by the telecommunication industry.

^^^Little ^^^late ^^^to ^^^all ^^^of ^^^this, ^^^but ^^^I ^^^just ^^^wanted ^^^to ^^^put ^^^in ^^^my ^^^2 ^^^cents ^^^as ^^^well ^^^as ^^^summarize ^^^what ^^^other ^^^people ^^^are ^^^saying.

So real quick... if you "abuse" the fact you use your unlimited data then you will get throttled when a tower has too much pressure on it AND you are over 23gb a month.

This has its ups and downs, but compared to how other companies throttle mobile data this is a "better" means of handling the situation. I just wanted to sum up other comments to get a better understanding of this for myself.

---

#Things to be "happy" about:
- Sprint still has "unlimited" plans at all
- Most customers won't be effected, even streaming music several hours a day on your business commute should not get you over 23gb.
- This imposed throttle is not "permanent," compared to other companies who will constantly throttle high data-use customers
- This throttle should only come into effect towards the end of your billing cycle, before the counter is reset
- Even if you are over 23gb of monthly data use, you might not be throttled IF a tower is not at max capacity
- Sprint is taking the 3 seconds required to inform customers, more than other companies do.

---
#Things to be sad about:
- Sprint's coverage is still worse than some other companies
- Sprint's average speeds are on the low side, many populated areas still rely on 3G
- **People using too much data are labeled as "abusing the system" for "unreasonable" use of the mobile-data even though they bought unlimited data for the intentions of using it.**
- If you consider data plans as download-limit \* speed then this does make the plan less than "unlimited"
- Sprint is changing a previously created plan with no plans of grandfathering or otherwise compensating customers already on it

---

Over all I think this is better than what other companies have done, but I can understand that there will be and why there will be backlash at Sprint both by those that actually understand the consequences of this change as well as the (presumably) small percentage of customers this actually effects. With 23gb of un-throttled data you can still do a LOT of things before being throttled and even then you might not be throttled depending on how strong Sprint's infrastructure is and if it is a high-stress time of day for the region.

Sprint is giving a gracious amount of data before they start throttling. I'll give myself as an example: as someone who would watch League of Legends EU and NA LCS Streams on my commute home from work at medium quality on a 720p screen... so 2 hours a day for 2 days a week of video streaming I would manage to go through 12-13gb of data a month. This is also including other uses like social media, reddit, and music streaming if I was out and WiFi was unavailable.

That all being said, I think the wording of "unreasonable" useage is very unfair to label customers who are PAYING FOR UNLIMITED data for said using unlimited data. I'm also peeved that there is no mention of compensation for those who are having their data-plans changed on them.

---

Large in part, problems like this would not need to arise if these wealthy companies took the time and relatively small amounts of money to actually upgrade their infrastructure. It's so much cheaper for them to simply charge more for using data to an ever-growing customer base and not actually change anything than it is to meet the demands of customers who have very few, or no, choices in better alternatives.
24
4677 :: Sprint to throttle 'unfair' customers using more than 23GB of data pe...
Sprint unlimited data plans are literally the only reason I'm using them.


If they don't realize this gives them a competitive advantage and instead go with the bullshit industry "standards" of their competitors, then they'll be judged solely on the merits of their network coverage and speed, and this is not a battle they will win.

They didn't whine to the government for the last couple years to ban Netflix and protect their monopoly. You know what other countries do when people riot? They call the cops.

Hey, lets burn a few cars and force the government to pay every French citizen 1 million Euros each for the government's stupidity, because its obvious you can suspend laws, civility, and get whatever you damn well please if you make life even semi-inconvenient in France.

Taxi services are as much private transportation services as Uber.

But taxi drivers are held to a higher standard than Uber drivers. And Uber clearly has a competitive edge by refusing to acknowledge legislation pertaining to taxi services.

How does that make sense?

4661 :: Man accidentally deletes his entire company with one line of bad code
Rm -rf just marks the blocks as empty. As long as he hasn't written anything new, there are recovery utilities that can recover nearly all of the data.

It des break the block linking chain so it can be a bit of effort but it's doable. A friend suffered having a hacker do this to his server. It took him four months but he got almost everything back.

4661 :: Man accidentally deletes his entire company with one line of bad code
It looks like they are talking about https://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf .

I have the impression it is a fake story:

First off, in a modern OS, rm -rf / shouldn't have worked like that, it should have failed. Unless you use a very specific option (--no-preserve-root). 

Secondly, when you read his comments, some things stand out.

For instance, when a user suggests to take a mirror of one of the disks to a new one, to try recovery software on it, using dd, he comments that he has accidentally switched the if and of options, and by doing so, wiped the original disk instead of making a mirror of it.

Now, i understand people make mistakes, so the initial failure (thou strange as of my first comment) is acceptable. But at this point, even if he is panicking, after reading all the comments to calm down first and checking everything at least 3 times with the manuals, he should have given the dd command a good validation before running it. 

If it is not fake: i'm sorry for him and i hope he can figure out a way to at least stay safe from the legal ramifications. On the other hand, as a linux server/network admin myself, i feel that it is a stark lesson to all of us to remember to always have a testing/staging environment before doing something on production. And it shows you why back best practices are there to protect you.

[They don't link to the post, so here it is. ](https://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf)  

Here's the deal: Not only does CentOS 7, the OS he tagged, require --no-preserve-root to do what he did, but, after all of that, he 'swapped "if" and "of"' while attempting to use dd to recover. Maybe he tagged the wrong OS? Doesn't matter if he's using a Linux OS from the last 10 years (which any company of this size would be). Switching the direction of dd when your company is at stake? Highly doubtful. 

Further, he asked "how to do a backup without mounting a remote drive on the server". He runs a company like this and doesn't know about rsync? Come on.  

Lastly, this is "from a backup maintenance script" and the "rm -rf {foo}/{bar}" clearly hadn't experienced the "bug" before or his company would have been gone long before. If it was a new script, why would you *ever* mount your backup drives before testing it?

Pretty well accepted over on /r/sysadmin and at the OP after the dd comment that it's a trolling post. In the incredibly unlikely chance that this is not the case, he had better pray he didn't use his real name because, otherwise, he just identified himself as the single most incompetent sysadmin on the face of the planet.

4661 :: Man accidentally deletes his entire company with one line of bad code
a rite of passage in a previous company was always the new guy deleting the production database by accident. We learned the hard way that backing up wasn't enough. Being able to *recover* was the key.

I feel for the guy.

ERRATUM: I *was* that guy, albeit on a smaller scale.

Expert opinion is skeptical on the story since not only did he manage to run 'rm -rf /' he also fucked up the 'dd' command recommended to him.

I think a lot of you are missing the whole big picture here. 

Going to the moon isnnt just about living there. It's a low gravity environment perfect for launching spacecraft to other planets! The biggest hurdle about space travel and launching rockets into space is gravity!

We build a staging platform on the moon and we need less fuel and resources to get places. 

The moon is also ripe with resources we could mine and send back to earth.

This isn't your grandparents moon trip people. This is about getting us to other planets.

Laws need to be enacted that make patent trolling illegal. Perhaps that the patent holder cannot enforce the patent without having a profitable product that relies on that patent.

4653 :: The Paris Attacks Were An Intelligence Community Failure, Not An 'Enc...
Sooo the italics don't really back this guy's point up.

You'd need seriously hardcore analytical hardware (warehouses of computers) and extremely diligent hotel staff/systems to search all businesses & hotels in France for terrorists on a rolling basis (hell, even on a weekly basis) that can crossreference to this list. Then, you'd have to find a way to surveil them. 

It's not like France has a cloud barrier that instantly sends all texts to a bunker of people reading them for context. And you can use burners, so people have no idea who is sending the text. And if you write in short hand, or just use common phrases like, "we're ready, let's go," then of course you wont connect that to a terrorist attack. This is human code - which the author clearly doesn't comprehend.

Do you know what a repeat criminal is? 

This just seems like a band-wagon criticism of the people presiding over a tragedy. What, was 9/11 similarly a failure? No, culture was different. Systems were different. Money had to be pumped in to make up for holes in security. 

Finally, you better bet your sweet ass that EVERYTHING you read in the media is sensationalized for clicks and NOT COMPLETE.

Security agencies do NOT share everything about open issues, like this - obviously. Just because some guy who wrote words online says person x is innocent, doesn't mean that the security agency has nothing on him. They just don't release it. The media is annoying and spins everything in poor taste; log on to CNN at any point of any day and 90% of the linked headlines are horribly depressing.

It certainly isn't an issue of a lack of information. It can be argued that the problem is actually quite the opposite. Agencies such as the FBI and NSA are absolutely overwhelmed with information and possible leads on a daily basis. The real challenge is connecting all the dots and differentiating between the legitimate leads and false positives. Then it's a question of whether or not there is even enough manpower to pursue all the legitimate threats. 

The failure of the intelligence community is not due to a lack of information. It's due to a fundamental flaw in strategy.

 Im from Belgium and I'm furious with the Belgian intelligence agency (and justice in general).

In our capital Brussels there are 6 police zones and 19 subcities (while new york for example has 1 police zone) making it very difficult to work across zones.

They had numerous indications that those guys were radicalising and plotting something (they suspected Abdeslam on 3 previous terrorist acts) and he still wasnt signaled on Interpol

Abdeslam befriended one of the others in jail couple of years ago and they knew this. He still wasn't signaled on interpol.

He was stopped crossing the border with austria couple of months ago and still wasnt signaled at Interpol.

He was even stopped in a car RIGHT AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS at the border with Belgium but because he wasnt signaled, they let him go...

So many mistakes, so many failures which led to this.

They need to step up their intelligence game BIG TIME.

BTW, a radicalising 15 year old was released for third time by a judge just a week ago (after the attacks)... He didn't "pose a threat")

If I recall correctly, the meters used to monitor usage are fully controlled by Comcast, are not certified or accredited. Someone needs to sue over this one aspect as they are charging based on usage that they control the keys to without any accountability. If they want to act like a utility, they the meters need to be subject to extreme scrutiny so shit like ad-injection can't be used to boost consumption.

4651 :: For US, Limiting Unlimited Data Plans Is The New Normal
I just got off the phone with t-mobile because I was planning on downgrading my unlimited plan to a plan 1-tier lower, but then he told me that "he's been hearing talks that we may be getting rid of this plan, but if you stay on it you would be grandfathered in". 

So, I told him I would think on that and give them a call back if I changed my mind. And then I come and find this article, as well as [this article from The Verge on Verizon](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9478093/verizon-increasing-unlimited-data-price), [and this other article](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3p3d76/sprint_to_throttle_any_unlimited_users_using_over/) from /r/news about Sprint doing the same thing.

So... I'm thinking that of course t-mobile will follow in their footsteps and overcharge grandfathered plans if they do decide to ditch their unlimited plan. I probably won't stay on this plan since most of my data is from streaming songs (which t-mobile doesn't hold against your data cap anyways).

I propose "unlimited" to mean no artificial limitation. Natural network congestion is ok and happens. Throttling is not natural. 
234
4651 :: For US, Limiting Unlimited Data Plans Is The New Normal
In France it's never called "unlimited", they'll never cut you off, but you get full speed up to for example 50GB, reduced speed after that (not all providers actually reduce speed, but contractually can). They'll call it a 50GB plan.

National calls (and landlines within the EU/US) are truly unlimited in numbers, but with a maximum call duration of 3h each (you just call back after that).

**EDIT:** Oh yeah.. 50GB of 4G with unlimited calls and SMS? [that's $23 inc. taxes](https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fmobile.free.fr&edit-text=&act=url).

The real bullshit is data plans are mandatory on devices that can run just fine without a data plan. Maybe I just want voice for my phone and can run the data off wifi(which is damn near everywhere), but thats not an option.

4651 :: For US, Limiting Unlimited Data Plans Is The New Normal
Still better than Australia, where a 2-3 GB data cap is considered the norm, with excess data charges for anything used on top of that. If I were to download 23 GB of data in one month, my phone bill would literally be $260 AUD ($190 USD).

Doing the opposite of what is claimed is very normal in america, and has been for a lomg time.
25
4651 :: For US, Limiting Unlimited Data Plans Is The New Normal
Why hasn't anyone pointed out the most basic equation that's relevant to this -- distance = rate x time. Or in this case downloaded data = download speed x time. 

Considering time is constant (billing period) that means that the amount of data you download and your speed are proportional. Thus if you limit speed, you are inherently placing a data download cap. In layman's terms, if I have a speed cap of 5Mb/s my maximum monthly data download is 1.62TB if I download constantly at that cap. Whereas if I have true 4G over the course of the month, it's anywhere from 4 to 20 times greater. I don't see how the FCC can ignore this simple relationship between speed and download quantity and let them essentially place data caps in a backdoor way.

Relevant comment from r/Android:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3tthv0/google_can_reset_the_passcodes_when_served_with_a/cx91grs

TL;DR With Android 5.0 Lollipop and above as long as you have encryption enabled, this is no longer possible.
921
4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
But not your encryption keys. So encrypt.
247
4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
If it's just resetting the passcode for access, that's ok. It seems this  does not apply to encryption though:

>For Android devices running operating systems Lollipop 5.0 and above, however, Google plans to
use default full-disk encryption, like that being used by Apple, that will make it impossible for Google
to comply with search warrants and orders instructing them to assist with device data extraction. 

which is good. You still have a way to keep your stuff private.
29
4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
I mean, if it's gone far enough that they have both a legitimate search warrant and a legitimate court order, then that's not really warrantless surveillance.
1375
4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
This is not surprising at all. Without full disk encryption, you can do it on android, Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. I even did this yesterday when I forgot my password on my Linux machine,which is almost identical to android.

Encrypt your devices! It's not only the government who can do so, it can be people who want to steal your information.

4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
Also it's good to note that depending on the case and warrants involved you are notified. 

[Google Transparency](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/legalprocess/#what_does_google_do)

>If you receive a legal request concerning my account, will you tell me about it?

>If Google receives ECPA legal process for a user's account, it's our policy to notify the user via email before any information is disclosed. (If the account is an Enterprise Apps hosted end user account, notice may go to the domain administrator, or the end user, or both.) This gives the user an opportunity to file an objection with a court or the requesting party. If the request appears to be legally valid, we will endeavor to make a copy of the requested information before we notify the user.
>There are a few exceptions to this policy:

>A statute, court order or other legal limitation may prohibit Google from telling the user about the request;
We might not give notice in exceptional circumstances involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person;
We might not give notice when we have reason to believe that the notice wouldn’t go to the actual account holder, for instance, if an account has been hijacked.
We review each request we receive before responding to make sure it satisfies applicable legal requirements and Google's policies. In certain cases we'll push back regardless of whether the user decides to challenge it legally.

Just an FYI if a system like this exists, in the USA you have to comply with the warrants. If the system did not exist, or if it were not possible, government agencies cannot compel a company, like Google, to build it to aid the government.

Why is google getting a warrant for MY device.

The warrant should be served to me.
12
4639 :: "Google can reset the passcodes when served with a search warrant and...
I have issues with this passage:

> Previous Apple and Google operating systems allowed law enforcement to access data on
devices pursuant to search warrants. There is no evidence of which we are aware that any
security breaches have occurred relating to those operating systems. **Apple and Google
have never explained why the prior systems lacked security or were vulnerable to hackers,
and thus, needed to be changed.** Those systems appeared to very well balance privacy and
security while still being accessible to law enforcement through a search warrant. 

The public availability of [devices](http://www.cellebrite.com/Pages/ios-forensics-physical-extraction-decoding-and-analysis-from-ios-devices) like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Cellebrite-Touch-Mobile-Phonebook-Transfer/dp/B00979EBDM), with older (but still functional) devices available on ebay cheaper, is the only "evidence" that the previous operating systems were inherently flawed and required changes to be made more secure.  The fact that without encryption the barrier to entry for any schmuck off the street to know everything my phone knows about me is monetary disturbs me greatly.

I am not ok with my mobile phone being used as part of exploratory evidence collection against me.  The 4th amendment guaranteed that my forebears were secure in their "papers" and persons, which in this modern era means that if I'm carrying it around with me, you need a real good reason to take a look at it.  Especially when it contains a copy of all of my recent communications, where I have been, and who I have been talking to.

I'm assuming this is to prevent people from messing with the spectrum.  Is the FCC forgetting that there are a plethora of cheap, open source SDR devices like the [HackRF One](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13001) which give you unrestricted access to the spectrum anyway?  Also, for anyone who seriously wants to mess with the spectrum, USRPs are another very powerful tool.
43
4635 :: The FCC is asking for comments on a proposal to require manufacturers...
They should be doing the exact opposite. It should be illegal for OEMs and ISPs to lock down devices they sell to consumers. The fact that my phone's bootloader is locked, preventing me from updating my phone's OS with security patches, is asinine. The FCC should be suing and fining the companies that do this because it's entirely anti-consumer.
254
4635 :: The FCC is asking for comments on a proposal to require manufacturers...
The actual rules haven't changed, from what I can see.

The FCC requires that the "responsible party" file for certification of the device, and obtain an FCC ID for it.

Modifications require recertification in most cases, and if the modification was not performed by the original manufacturer, the FCC ID cannot be reused for fairly obvious reasons.

Even the bit about technical measures against modification isn't exactly new, because it hasn't been a point of contention before, because radio modules were typically certified on their own, and mobile phones had dedicated "application" and "baseband" processors.

This is now changing, as integrated solutions are using unified designs. Modifying the firmware for such a design will require recertification unless people really know what they are doing.

So, software updates are prohibited except if you take responsibility. The question is why manufacturers should be required to make it hard to install such an update.

From a safety point of view, that makes a bit of sense, but I can see that it also locks me out if I am prepared to take over the certification work. So I'm still unhappy.

My SDR is not really affected -- this is labelled as laboratory equipment and will not be used with antennas, because that would be a) unlawful, and b) stupid because it doesn't conform anyway.

Yaaa.... Mini is owned by BMW and since BMW took over their floor space this is clearly something the parent company decided.

The Land Rover cars probably broke down on the way to the show with some weird electrical problems that they figured would take another four months to solve.

And finally let's be honest about Tesla, they don't have a huge lineup and their cars sell themselves. People either want one or they don't. They also have a much stronger internet presence than traditional auto manufacturers and probably don't need to compete on a trade show floor so that is just a waste of money for them.

There used to be a time when the police werent such pussies. When upholding the law, instead of holding your self above it, was the reason for being an officer. They treat it like a fraternity, whenever a fellow officer is breaking the law they all just cower behind some unwritten code of conduct that only they follow. When my coworkers break the rules, I tell the manager. When I hit someone else's car, I wait for them, and take the punishment. When police get in trouble or see fellow officers getting in trouble, they diddle each other's pussies and expect us to understand why. We don't, you're crooked. If Americans have guns, why aren't they using them for citizen arrests?

4606 :: Amazon employee who wrote a rebuttal to The New York Times worked 100...
tl;dr: Your experience at Amazon entirely depends on your manager and your department, but the environment is toxic any way you slice it.

What people are missing here is that Amazon is huge and every team is completely independent in terms of how it is run.

I worked in an org where people tend to work 8 hours each day and play board games for 90 minutes during lunch and the work hours weren't so bad. I generally came in around 10:30 and would work until anywhere between 6 and 9, depending on when I felt like leaving.

However, there were teams on the same floor as me where everyone showed up at 8am, left at 7pm, and would promptly sign online and be active until 2am. No, they weren't forced to work that many hours. If they decided to work just 8 hour days it would effect their reviews and they wouldn't get promoted.

Amazon has a policy that every org has to fire their 10% worst performers. If you have a team of all-stars, your only option is to target someone on another team and do what you can to move them out. It makes the environment competitive. People that you should be friends with (considering you see them more than anyone else in your life) end up being competitors. Amazon has build a business where individual contributions matter the most and working with others gets you no where. You need to lead projects and take as much credit as you can for yourself to succeed.

Sure, some people will do well in that environment but I found it incredibly toxic.

>Regardless of whether Ciubotariu's horror story does indeed describe his time at Microsoft, there's a larger point to be made about how difficult it is to work at a top-tier tech company. Though companies like Facebook and Netflix have instituted policies meant to improve work-life balance, long hours are still very much the norm.

Yes, some tech companies are worse than others from a work/life balance standpoint. However, Amazon has been shown to not only abuse their white collar workers (who can go to another company fairly easily), but also the blue collar warehouse workers who often don't have that option.

That's not to excuse any tech company who does that, but Amazon seems to do it across the board instead of just in certain working groups (where it's generally an issue with an insane manager or VP)

This isn't a rebuttal. What someone asks of you and what is expected can be different. He says, no one asks him to do these things, yet he doesn't say if he does them or not. Nor if there are any consequences to not doing them. Nor about the performance evaluations that lead to mandatory downsizing of 'least' performing individuals (even after other incredibly successful tech companies have ceased this practice as it can fail to retain valuable workers).

1. Famous YouTube prankster/vlogger Jesse Wellens finds the robot in Philly as seen here in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTP8prb-zO8&amp;t=7m48s).
2. Jesse [tweets to his fans](https://twitter.com/Jessewelle/status/627387761885102080) to pick it up at Elfreth's Alley (the oldest residential street in the nation).
3. Jesse posts the vlog (where he finds the hitchBOT) the next day where [he admits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTP8prb-zO8&amp;t=10m42s) that he's not able to take the robot to Washington D.C., so he needs a fan to do it for him.

This is going to be interesting.  See, the area around your home, often called the curtilage, enjoys 4th amendment protection. It's why cops can't come snooping around your house without permission.  However, if they can see something from the street, or from your front door when they knock, they can seize it or arrest you for it.  It's been a semi settled area of the law for a long time.

Drones open up a whole new realm. If they are able to fly over your backyard, and they see you engaged in some illegal activity, then is it a search or not?  There have been cases involving helicopters and how they can't just hover over your house, but I assume drones will be a bit different. 

I've got no problem with them using them in hostage situations to do recon, or something similiar.  But, I have a significant problem with police flying them around without a warrant. What's to stop some officer from becoming a peeping Tom, or spying on his enemies, or harassing groups he finds offensive. 

I believe, as a society, we need to I mpose a warrant requirement for drone searches.

Police cruisers rushing to locations in hot pursuit. Family pleading and crying in the bottom corner.  

The first suspect is tracked by drone for miles and taken down by police. It's not him. One lead after another is false until they find her safe and sound. Another happy ending.

Made up headline. Cops are not asking ancestry.com and 23andme for customer data. Cops accessed information that ancestry.com made publicly available.
599
4590 :: Cops are asking Ancestry.com and 23andMe for their customers’ DNA
I think the article means that DNA Databases/Ancestry.com are used by the police to find matches/relatives to DNA samples they have. If they are similar they get a court order to obtain it.

Please tell me if i made a mistake here.

There was something similar in Germany regarding this. If one of the participants of a Mass DNA test had similar DNA to the DNA that was being looked out for, they would look at their relatives for being potential crime suspects. This was banned however.
370
4590 :: Cops are asking Ancestry.com and 23andMe for their customers’ DNA
Well that's a misleading title.  It just talks about one case where the cops accessed a database that Ancestry.com had made publicly available.

23andMe isn't listed at all.

My main issue with this isn't exactly what they are doing, but it is how the legal system treats positive results.

They used to convict people on positive blood matches. You have AB- blood, well we found AB- at the crime scene.

Ok, i am not very familiar with the american system: so i totally believe he actually wants to end NSA spying from what he knows now. But _could_ he even do that? I mean, if he's president, he is _just_ president. Could he just tell a federal agency to stop a program? Could, for example, a president just command NASA [sic!] to stop a certain space program? Or would he either need to do this indirectly (e.g. by severely cutting their budget) or would he need to have the congress approve?

Be careful with this. A lot of tech companies do the "unlimited" time off thing, which is really "as much as you feel is right for your job", which if you value your job better be "very little or none".

Basically, by putting it on the employee you're making their decision a direct reflection of how much they value their job. Most people will opt for either the industry standard or less because otherwise it looks like they don't care.

It is a nice idea in theory but in practice it is often better to give a set amount so that people can take all of it without other penalties.

You can take 49 or 59 weeks payed leave. With 100% and 80% pay respectivly. 10 weeks are reserved for the mother and 10 weeks are reserved for the father. And the remaining 29/39 weeks are freely dividable by the parents. The goverment payes the wages in this period. 

And the myth that "work place relationships" are affected by this, is quite frankly bullshit.. You are frowned apon if you DONT take your full leave..

This will probably turn out as well as the guy who raised the minimum wage at his company to $70K.

4574 :: Netflix Announced a Game-Changing Parental Leave Policy - it’s allowi...
I'm having a kid in a couple of weeks, and we're having 49 weeks off work with full pay. This is by law in Norway. By the way, I am the owner of the company, with ~30 employees. We have people out on leave all the time, and it works out well. Sure it brings challenges, but nothing we can't solve. If your company tumbles because an employee is out for a year, you're doing it wrong.

I don't think an open and unlimited model like Netflix has is a good idea, because it can force a culture of taking less time than you're entitled to. For instance, your team can make you feel bad for taking the full year.

That $100 Million, at today's costs, could go to build out 3300 miles of fiber on the road with connections to each premises. (Not to mention add jobs.)

It's not a new tax on electric cars. It is just putting the same tax on electric cars that there Is on regular cars.

The tax is not emission or pollution based. It is a way of taxing luxury vehicles in Denmark. And since the tesla easily could be compared to an audi a8 in luxury, now it will be priced as one.

One of the reasons our government is doing this, is because they made some miscalculations for projections of the gas prices. At the time the prices were thought to continue their rise,  but the opposite happened. These projections were part of the what the last financial plans were based upon, and now they are trying to find other methods to make up for this. Personally I don't think this will lead to more money for the government, but only a huge decrease in sales of electric vehicles, which is a shame. 
62

4572 :: Tesla to fight Denmark's new tax on electric cars
This makes perfect sense,  and it is not at all unfair for Tesla, it just puts them back in the competition with all the other car makers out there.


The tax relief only created a loophole for wealthy people, so they could purchase a luxury car, for the same price as a medium sized Mercedes, BMW or Audi.

The current tax on automobiles has nothing to do with the environment, in fact car owners pay a separate tax for that alone, measured by how much the car pollutes etc.

If anything should be changed, the tax should be removed from all cars, regardless of the type. This would also allow a mediocre family, to purchase a much newer and safer family car. Rather than an old, used, and more polluting car.

I'm not sure how you can morally argue against free, albeit limited, internet for the poor on the grounds of 'Net Neutrality'. Especially when you are not poor yourself, which you are not, since you are on reddit.

Is India so against giving poor people free internet? What are they afraid of? Seems like the height of arrogance to me to assume you speak for poor people that can barely afford SMS. Why not ask them what they think?

Wow, Google and Apple had an illegal anti-poaching agreement and when HR Fuckstick learned that one of his employees called someone at Apple he promised the Apple HR Fuckstick that the person would be "terminated within the hour".

4558 :: Comcast's CEO Wants the End of Unlimited Data
What I find interesting is the way they are trying to compare internet use like water, electric, gas, etc. These are almost always businesses that are provided by a government entity or a regulated utility company. In either case heavy regulations are applied (rightfully so) to those businesses due to usually being a monopoly and a real necessity. Yet Comcast and the other ISP's balk at the idea of being regulated like a utility and bitterly fight any municipal competition. Net neutrality took a very small step in that direction but is incredibly light in regulations compared to what, say, your local power utility may encounter. If they want people to start viewing them that way then they may just get what they deserve from regulators one day. Probably unlikely to happen, but I find it odd that they want to be compared to those businesses.

Suitcase locks are a joke with the sole purpose of keeping the bag from opening.

I'm not as worried about theft as the opposite. Baggage handlers have been known to put drugs in people's luggage. Someone is supposed to pick them up at the other end. It doesn't always happen. Then some random innocent person shows up with drugs in their baggage, say in a country that has the death penalty for drug smuggling...

So yeah, I want a fucking lock on my fucking luggage.

Copying this comment from a [comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3n0ded/study_63_percent_of_cable_users_dont_know_if/cvjss3v) on the same story in a different sub:

I find myself pretty skeptical of any studies run by a site called cutcabletoday.com. Seems like they might have an agenda to push. 

Reading through their article it becomes evident that the survey question they asked was "How likely are you to be using each paid service 12 months from now?" but they then present their results in a binary format (sure, not sure). A format which doesn't appear to conform with the relevant survey question, without some sort of manipulation of the data (not saying that's bad, just that they did something with it before presenting it). 

What's bad is that they didn't tell us anything about the treatment of the data. 

I really don't see how they get from "how likely are you to use" to "don't know if they'll keep". Seems like a leap, and I suspect the agenda of the website has something to do with it. 

Not to mention they don't release any info about their sample pool beyond sample size. Was it a phone survey? An internet survey? In person? What country? What state? Multiple states? Any one of these options will result in a different sample bias (age and income being the most obvious). The lack of any mention of this makes me extremely skeptical of the results. 

Finally, they surveyed these people in July 2014. Over a year ago. Did we see anywhere close to a 63% decline in cable subscriptions in the last year?

No.

TL;DR: This title is just clickbait to appeal to the popularity of the cable-cutting mindset among younger folks. It doesn't release any detail about its survey or data treatment methodology, and over a year later, the claims that they've made just haven't been borne out.

I actually just ordered my cable back after not having it for quite a while.  I do like netflix, but I miss just turning the tv on and channel surfing.  I miss just simply watching new episodes of shows rather than trying to find it somewhere online to stream, or messing around with downloading crap.

Also cartoons.  The same way that I get caught up watching 3 seasons of 30 Rock in a night, my kids want to power through hours worth of the same tv shows.  At least with Treehouse/YTV there's a bit of variety.

My biggest problem with cable is that it's excruciatingly archaic.

When cable first debuted in the 80's, people found their programming via the programming schedule channel - that rolling list of what's playing on which channels. And *that thing is still around*, because it's even more painful to use the providers' websites.

1080p televisions and 5.1 audio became living room standards about 15 years ago, when DVDs first became popular. We've had it so long that the next-gen standard, 4k, is starting to take hold. And yet, today, HD cable is typically 720p and stereo.

No package customization. Even though customers have been asking for it for 30 years.

You want to watch a single show? Like, *only* Thanksgiving Day football? Nope, the only way to get that programming is to sign up for a year of the sports package...

The hardware is still flaky - more than ever, actually. It's still impossible to get an HD stream without frequent hiccups and visual artifacts. It's still dependent upon technicians coming out and futzing with your cable box, and your cable modem, and a CableCard, and maybe you can sometimes get some channels but not others...

The entire industry is mired in the 1990's. It has invested its energy in locking in its monopolies, and blocking technologies like TiVo, and fighting congressional bills that try to drag it into the 21st century, and obsessing over people stealing its service to the detriment of its *actual customers*.

Its death is long overdue. It cannot come soon enough.

4541 :: Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' security
TL;DR - Apple did not clearly state the impact of the iOS9 security improvements to those that had 3rd party repairs.

I searched error 53 on Apple's site

https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204770

Under code 53...

*Check for hardware issues

Errors: 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 53, 56, 1002, 1004, 1011, 1012, 1014, 1667, or 1669.

Your device or computer might have a hardware issue that stops the update or restore from completing.

    Check that your security software and settings aren't blocking your device from communicating with the Apple update server.
    Then try to restore your iOS device two more times while connected with a cable, computer, and network you know are good.
    Make sure that your security software and settings are allowing communication between your device and update servers.
    If you still see the error message when you update or restore, contact Apple support.

If you still see the error message, check for outdated or modified software.*

Not particularly insightful in light of current events.

The point in favor of the customer is there is no "easy to find" consequence (aside from nullifying the warranty and support from Apple) from having a third party repair the device. I ignored recent posts and articles on the issue just to determine if a user could reasonably determine prior to recent events the consequence of repairing an idevice through a third party. I searched through the iphone user guide, info pdf's, googled error 53, and tried sourcing other channels within Apple's web site, for anything outlining the devices would be disabled if compromised. Didn't find anything readily relevant. 

To those arguing the value of secured data - I do not doubt your argument. Technically, you're right, and it would be a reasonable course of action to protect your data. It should also be clearly disclosed.

There is no explicit physical consequence listed in the iPhone manual or related documents for having the device repaired by a third party. A customer would not get the impression the device would be disabled after reading the supplied documents. Consequences to Apple's Warranty and willingness to repair third party repaired devices at the end of warranty are described, not device bricking. The warranty is a year long, contracts can last longer, and a non warranty repair from Apple are pricey. That, and the consequence of updating a third party repaired idevice from iOS 8 to 9 is not obvious either. 

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/02/05/iphone-6-killing-error-53-highlights-big-ios-9-problem/#66b61924284a) covered the issue as well. Information posted by Apple regarding the changes to Touch id,

"[Improved security with two-factor authentication support and a default 6 digit passcode support for Touch ID devices](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1842?locale=en_US)", that's it.

Following the Apple support link relating to the page above (for Touch ID), security information regarding changes to "Touch ID". If they clearly stated "The device will be completely and permanently disabled if repaired by an unauthorized third party, and will no longer be supported in any way by Apple" one can argue against recent complaints. It doesn't.

I don't particularly agree with it but there it is....

4541 :: Apple says iPhone 'Error 53' is to protect customers' security
I recall fixing an iPhone 5S screen for a friend. The home button (with fingerprint sensor) was also damaged. However, after replacing the screen & button, Touch ID simply did not work (as we knew would happen), because the button and the motherboard had a mismatch. This is perfectly acceptable. Why they had to go 1 step further with this 'Error 53' nonsense is typical Apple. Hopefully there's enough pushback and bad press that they reverse their feelings on this. However, that's unlikely.

The rhetoric of "not allowing a safe space for terrorists to communicate" is complete bullshit.

4533 :: David Cameron's proposed encryption ban would 'destroy the internet'
The absurd thing is that he wants to ban chat applications with built-in encryption. To catch terrorists. As in, a terrorist wouldn't be smart enough to, I dunno, encrypt the message and then send the encrypted message over an unencrypted channel?

Right. So next the UK is going to destroy all private buildings, and completely level the entire islands. This vast empty wasteland will ensure no terrorists can hide.

David Cameron is a moron. We have some serious philosophical differences when it comes to individual liberty, but this move of his is really him just being completely incompetent and/or having terrible advisers. At its heart, encryption is essentially an agreed upon rule for turning one set of characters to another set of characters (and back). How do you ban something like that?    
    
The fact of the matter is that the people that we really need to worry about - the clever ones - will not be using software with compromised encryption.

4533 :: David Cameron's proposed encryption ban would 'destroy the internet'
>encryption is one of the things that protects us from terrorists, criminals, foreign intelligence, and every other threat on the Internet, and against our data and communications. Encryption protects our trade secrets, our financial transactions, our medical records, and our conversations. In a world where cyberattacks are becoming more common and more catastrophic, encryption is one of our most important defenses.

It's time people (politicians) start mentioning this. I'm getting so sick of hearing people say that we should ban this and that and have more and more security everywhere because of terrorists. 

The whole point of terrorism is to spread terror. If we don't stop giving up liberties, we're only letting them win.

"Around 30% more Bing search queries per Windows 10 device vs. prior versions of Windows."

If I'm not mistaken, Microsoft owns Bing and can simply look at the User Agent being sent on each search query - a lot of this data can be acquired through widely used methods. While I don't like Windows 10 because of all the things it DOES collect (if you let it), arguments against it should specifically show things that actually need to use the Windows 10 OS to collect the data.

**Tell the FCC what you think of these new rules here:** https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/06/2015-18402/equipment-authorization-and-electronic-labeling-for-wireless-devices

Anyone from any country can provide comments, they want to hear from individuals outside the United a states as well! 


1. Go to the Federal Register and press "Submit a formal comment"
2. Start your comment by respectfully asking the FCC to not implement rules that take away the ability of users to install the software of their choosing on their computing devices.

3. Additional points of emphasis you should consider adding:

* Wireless networking research depends on the ability of researchers to investigate and modify their devices.

* Americans need the ability to fix security holes in their devices when the manufacturer chooses to not do so.

* Users have in the past fixed serious bugs in their wifi drivers, which would be banned under the NPRM.

* Billions of dollars of commerce, such as secure wifi vendors, retail hotspot vendors, depends on the ability of users and companies to install the software of their choosing.

* Mesh networking which helps first responders in emergencies, also helps provide anonymity, creates a backup/alternative communications network, will become more difficult than it needs to be with these new rules.

* Users should be able to manipulate and control all aspects of their devices. 

* Manufacures will likely employe digital locks is the easiest manner they can rather than worrying about letting you still use your device fully to the extent of the law. This means you get locked out of other things, cannot check for back doors, etc... It's cheaper to implement a lock that encompasses the entire device rather than trying to individually lock or unlock each little line of code depending on the legalities.

They're just going to create a huge market for open routers, sold as educational kits.

Chinese eBay sellers don't give a fuck about the FCC.

4518 :: The FCC proposed ‘software security requirements’ obliging WiFi devic...
So, if I'm correct in my understanding, then the FCC is attempting to prevent devices from using frequencies and power levels they are not supposed to be using. And their solution is soft/firmware based and will require some sort of complicated certification process. But to me, it seems intuitive that a better solution would simply to build more specialized hardware instead. Why don't they instead require that these devices be physically incapable of operating outside of their legal limits?

4515 :: Websites that reject ad-blocker readers don't deserve your clicks
For the last year or so, I've switched to considering ad-blockers to be a basic security requirement. Since websites trust ad engines to vet their placements, and the ad services DO NOT vet them (malware has and does get delivered via ad placement services), it's not smart to allow ads to be placed on your browser.
721
4515 :: Websites that reject ad-blocker readers don't deserve your clicks
This is basically the single largest problem facing Internet-based magazines/websites now: ad blocking continues to become mainstream thereby invalidating their business models.

The only way around it is a subscription service, but very few people are able to pull it off. 
51
4515 :: Websites that reject ad-blocker readers don't deserve your clicks
I'm more inclined to use ad blockers nowadays because of how much bandwidth ads consume. My phone is on Project Fi, so I pay $1 for every 100MB the phone uses. Ads that are based on Flash or play videos are problematic for me. The worst are video ads that force you to watch at least 5-7 seconds, because by then my phone will have downloaded most of the video.

Ad blocker is the sole reason why I would want to root my phone. For computers, I want to block ads because then pages load faster.
94
4515 :: Websites that reject ad-blocker readers don't deserve your clicks
As far as I understand the way most websites ad-blocker detectors work is the page is loaded (ie. your browser already has the page data and the HTML parser reconstructs the page), and if the JS detects that the ad elements weren't loaded an overlay comes up with the usual message ('Please disable ad-blocker') and preventing you from seeing the page.

But since, as I mentioned, the page has already been loaded, you already have all the data. So usually, if I'm feeling really flippant, you can just use chrome dev tools to delete the overlay element to see the underlying page. Its really as simple as Inspect Element > Delete Element.
49
4515 :: Websites that reject ad-blocker readers don't deserve your clicks

I run a few niche properties. The sites were designed around offering a good user experience without blasting obnoxious ads in your face.

The only ads run are AdSense and affiliate links to Amazon. They aren't all over the place. They aren't obnoxious. I don't run random adnetwork ads - despite a larger payout - because I don't believe in that.

All my content and media are 100% unique. I make it all myself. I put time and effort into making something that I can be proud of.

61% of my traffic uses AdBlock. It's running me out of business :(

Then I read comments from people who are all "So? Why should I care?"

Well, you will when sites like mine don't exist anymore.

I have been using sub inch accurate gps for at least a decade on our farm.  It is even that accurate for elevation.  I have what is known as RTK. Basically it is a system that combines Gps with a radio signal from a fixed location.  It is fairly expensive but a cheaper and almost accurate system is out there known as RTX.  A cell phone is used in RTX somehow.  I don't use that system so I don't know a lot about it.

I didn't read the actual IEEE paper, but from this article, it seems that the only thing the researchers did was make the combining of data more computationally efficient and able to be performed on mobile devices. The combing of the data has been done for years, but these researches just wrote a new algorithm. 
105
4503 :: Scientists Find a New Technique Makes GPS Accurate to an Inch
Differential GPS has been accurate to a few centimeters for over 2 decades.  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_navigation_device 

Civil Engineering Survey Instruments  that use DGPS combined with earthbound location stations are accurate to  thousands of a foot or even better, far surpassing the accuracy of all other types of measurement use before.  This ends up causing problems on long term deeded tracts of land because it reveals  the long term propagation of inaccurate measurements through multiple-generations of using each successive error, building to very significant errors at the end of a long chain of property divisions and changes of ownership.

I still have a couple of projects lingering on at SourceForge.

However, I just learned that you cannot easily delete them. I have therefore opened a ticket to do so.

- Here's a link to [open the ticket](https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/site-support/new/)

- [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Gv6juKg.png) of my ticket. (There are two, but the other one is substantially the same, for a different project.)

- Stackexchange [question about this subject](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/42490/can-you-delete-a-project-on-sourceforge).

I will update with the response, if any.

I think they should reward specific bounties or awards to developers who go out of their way to work on things like bug fixes, integration testing, etc. I know a website called bountysource.com or something exists for this, but that isn't enough.

4479 :: Self-Filling Water Bottle Converts Humid Air into Drinkable H2O
I read about this a year ago on reddit and it is as [unfeasible then as it is now](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/2m764k/never_refill_your_bike_water_bottle_generates_own/). In fact it is literally the same psuedoproduct in this article.

You might even call it (dons sunglasses) *vapourware*.

So it's powered by a solar panel.  Where is that solar panel? How big is it? Hopefully it is above you, because you're going to need some shade after lugging a mini fridge and solar panel strapped to your bike.  
156
4479 :: Self-Filling Water Bottle Converts Humid Air into Drinkable H2O
Engineer here.  Lemme give you the practical numbers.

Condensing moisture from humidity into water requires 9000 BTU/gal, if the air's already at the dewpoint, 100% humidity.  17 fluid ounces requires 1195 BTU to condense.

If this were the efficiency of a central air conditioner, this would use 92 watt-hrs of electricity.

But we're surely talking about Peltier solid-state cooling, which has not advanced significantly in 25 years or so.  If it did, it would be huge news.

Peltiers are like 10th the efficiency of R134a systems.  And the performance curve is really critical- if the heatsink gets significantly warm, the performance drops precipitously.  Heatsinks have to be huge to actually dissipate the wattage while not being particularly warm themselves.

So you'd need about one kilowatt-hr to make 17 ounces of water in 100% humidity conditions.  Just so you know, a fit person pedaling a generator for long periods without going anywhere will generate about 200W, so you'd need 5 hrs of work.  

Solar panel tech is about 14.5 watt per sq ft.  So to generate 1KW in 4 hours of decent sun a day, that would require over 17 sq ft of solar panels to produce the 250W output to condense 17 oz with a Peltier over the course of the day.  This doesn't make a lot of sense, you would not have that much sunlight in 100% humidity conditions.

What that shows is "moisture farming" is fantastically energy-intensive.  If you were going to condense water out of the air, you'd use conventional R134a/R410a refrigeration and counterflow heat exchangers.  The performance will be an order of magnitude better, but the bottom line STILL makes no sense.

If you had that much power, you'd probably find something better to do with it than making a few oz of water.  Water is a thing, but not THAT critical, and if it were, you would not have the means to be doing this sort of huge "solution".  Well if you're in a desert with no means of support and dying of thirst, yes 17 oz of drinking water is a big thing, but a massive, expensive solar array would not make any sense as a solution.  You need far more water than that to live and farm.

In any case, the proposal does not add up.  Nothing that size can condense 17 oz of water a day from solar, even under the most ideal conditions, however unlikely they may be.

I love these initial application technologies.   They are always larger and a bit clunky in design, but once the principle is out there, within a few years it may be possible to provide clean drinking water to thousands of people who don't have it, not to mention the military and other applications.

This thing is reposted every few months.  It doesn't work at anywhere near the level required to be useful.  If you took all the energy you spent pedaling and instead directed it to this thing (ie no forward movement) it still wouldn't work well enough to be practical.

Looks like they have a new video that shows a detachable, flexible solar panel to improve efficiency...still a scam.

Old guy here. I remember when they first started promoting cable TV. One of the big questions was, "Why would I want to pay for TV when I get it for free?" Their answer was, "You already pay for TV because ads influence your buying decisions. We don't have ads."

Time Warner can suck it. Yes the commercials are one annoyance but there are plenty of worse ones. Advertise an $89.99/month plan and when the bill comes it's $115 after all the bullshit taxes and fees? Plus try to jack my rate up after two years as a loyal paying customer? No thanks. We hardly watch the stupid crap that's on tv these days anyways. The only reason to have cable is live sports...and thanks to the greedy networks a shit ton of the games aren't even on regular tv anyways.  Plus you know, live streaming and stuff. 

We still have to pay Time Warner for internet because there's no cheaper option - as soon as Google Fiber comes online we're switching.

I don't think having fewer ads will be that helpful. It's not the length of the ads or even the ads itself, it's the convenience of picking any show (within reason) with no ads at all. Hulu has even begun allowing a no ad option which I think will greatly raise their demographic

They don't want FCC complaints because it allows the FCC to build a case against them and punish them through fines.  I think everyone should be doing this more but I doubt they know how to file complaints, a large portion of Internet users barely know how to setup a router or email account.

The FCC should have a large button that says "click for complaints about your internet provider" on the front page of its website or force the cable company's to have it on their webpages.

You'll only be heard when you decide to speak.
364
4447 :: Want­ a lower Comcast bill? Complain to the FCC
This is all fine and good; however, if they simply priced it fairly and consistently, people would flock to the service and stay loyal.

We jumped through cable hoops (pricing, promotions, specials, etc) for years. Guess what? Now we have an antenna for local channels and internet for other things - Netflix, Amazon, soon will have HBO, etc.

Thing is - we are in our 60's and are in the so-called demographic for cable users. We weren't supposed to be the ones with the antenna and internet entertainment.

The cable companies simply made it so infuriating to use their services we decided we didn't need them.

28
4447 :: Want­ a lower Comcast bill? Complain to the FCC
Comcast and TWC make a TON of money selling advertising on their hundreds of channels they shove at you.

They lose all that revenue for every person who dumps the TV service just to go to cable internet. 

THAT, is why, you get charged more just for Cable internet than having both, cause you are cutting off their dicks by not receiving their advertising via T.V.

Though I say cut that shit off anyway. They are so jacked in prices anyway, they could cut our bills in half and still be making money hand over fist.

I hope this fear of the FCC that reclassification has brought to Comcast extends to shelving there 5 year plan to have everyone of there customers on data caps.

His security staff was EVERYWHERE; in the isles, constantly walking around, talking into ear pieces, hovering over attendees.  This was going on throughout the entire show.  All the lights were on and if you even reached into your pocket you were harassed or removed by staff.  There wasn't a moment during his routine that somebody nearby wasn't getting talked to or kicked out.  Everyone, who was just moments before dancing and drinking and laughing with friends, were frozen stiff in their seats.  I have never felt so nervous and uncomfortable at a show in my whole life.

I get what Dave is trying to do, but his security was way over the top, very distracting, and affected my enjoyment of the show immensely.

CGI is absolutely not "out." CGI was used just as much (if not more than) practical effects in both Mad Max and EP.VII.

I think the point is to make stunts that are plausible.    
Some movie stunt are so ridiculous you know it's all CG BS.    
In Madmax you know they built de vehicles, they were functional and actually did the jumps you see in the movie.     
Sure tons of FXs are added, but the base of the stunt still make sense.

Film **publicity** focuses on the practical effects because that's what audiences want to hear about nowadays. But the caption being quoted is bullshit: the movies mentioned are showcasing elaborate CGI if you've ever seen it.

Regarding Mad Max: Fury Road, the article does mention this later: 

>Andrew Jackson, the movie’s visual-effects supervisor, told fxguide, “I’ve been joking recently about how the film has been promoted as being a live action stunt-driven film.… The reality is that there’s 2,000 VFX shots in the film”—out of about twenty-four hundred shots total.

Take a look at what a few of those 2000 VFX shots did to the film:

http://petapixel.com/2015/05/30/before-and-after-comparisons-of-the-visual-effects-in-mad-max-fury-road/

And "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" showcased the most  elaborate CGI of any Star Wars episode. Honestly, with such an un-original story I thought the well-executed, well-integrated visual effects were the best thing about that movie. Watch how some of the effects were done in [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G42oiW2EosU) -- it looks like a sane, rational approach to visual effects, but by no means an example of turning away from elaborate CGI.

That's the most idiotic and uninformed headline!!!! Both  Star Wars and Mad Max used extensive amounts of CGI, probably way more than most movies have in history. In, fact you could probably say that almost every single shot in the new Star Wars used some amount of CG elements, many were entirely CG. They did, however play to the strengths of both techniques, and do some interesting things (like bb8) practically. I bet many people don't realize that some of the wackiest looking effects in Mad Max were practical. When the guitar flies at screen, or the steering wheel? Those were practical elements shot against green screen.

Didnt anybody read the article?  Frist paragraph  "Put another way: they’ve been rewarded for sticking a bunch of practical effects onto a canvas of computer-generated imagery, or C.G.I."

No where in that article did they say "yeah 100% practical effects are in! No more cgi ever!"  It is about how the effective use of practical combined with CGI is whats in. Fury Road did an incredible job at that, as did Star Wars.  

59
4442 :: Hollywood’s Turn Against Digital Effects: Thanks to films like “Mad M...
What Mad Max and The Force Awakens did differently in my opinion was use real sets/locations/props to sell the use of VFX. When they're matching a real location and have real reference points the effect is better. It sells the illusion to the audience better.

I think in the 2000s we got to a point where it was easier during shooting to "let the cgi artists worry about it later" and you wind up with shots that look completely artificial.

There's also a video that makes the argument that we only notice bad CG. I don't completely agree - Star Wars Episode 3 had the most incredible CG work at the time, but the lack of reference shots and over reliance on 100% CGI locations, sets, vehicles, characters, and creatures made the whole thing feel like a really polished Pixar movie. There wasn't anything real for our minds to cue off of to sell the CGI.

Political theatre and nothing more. Right now the average public school day in NYC is already overly filled with previously promised mandates. There's simply not enough time in the day to do all the things all previous mayors have decided to make 'mandatory'.

One programming class in high school would have saved me a year in college in the wrong major.

And programming is taking a problem apart and stating it in simple way without room for interpretation.  A lot of people would benefit from learning to think like that.
24
4441 :: New York City plans to make computer science mandatory in all public ...
This article is kind of vague. Is it mandatory that all schools begin to offer computer science? Is it mandatory that all students take computer science?

It seems like it will be mandatory for all students to take it 
>New York will have to figure out how to squeeze yet another requirement into the schedule of already overburdened students.

which honestly sounds like a terrible idea depending on the level of complexity of the class. if it is extremely basic computer education, general use and some advanced use, then it's a waste of time in an overly-scheduled school system. If it is programming and such then it shouldn't be mandatory.

What should happen is that all schools should be forced to have an optional computer science class, emphasis on optional. most schools don't force students to take Art classes, so why force students to take a specific stem course.

The influx of students who otherwise wouldn't take the course will also negatively affect everyone who wants to be in the course.

I'm cynical. If they try to teach computer science the way they currently teach other subjects, it will fail. There is quite a difference in the amount talented programmers are paid compared to how much talented teachers are paid.

My high school had what was basically a long computer science course and I took it. The teacher was completely unqualified and unable to complete her own assignments. We were forbidden from programming anything which wasn't specifically in our tutorial textbook. Programming any other programs was not allowed. Creativity was explicitly not allowed. One of my friends programmed a program which beeped in a loop. It was his second offense and he was suspended.

The few of us who really wanted to program a little bit for fun did so in secret and hid files carefully. To say that it stifled all of us is an understatement. Remember that creativity in the public school system is not rewarded. On the front page right now is a student arrested for making an electronic clock and bringing it to school. This is not an environment where computer science will be learned.

Jeff Atwood is an awesome dude who co-founded StackOverflow/StackExchange and [wrote about this very topic in 2012](http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/)

And generally, I tend to agree with him:

*The "everyone should learn to code" movement isn't just wrong because it falsely equates coding with essential life skills like reading, writing, and math. I wish. It is wrong in so many other ways.* 

* *It assumes that more code in the world is an inherently desirable thing. In my thirty year career as a programmer, I have found this … not to be the case. Should you learn to write code? No, I can't get behind that. You should be learning to write as little code as possible. Ideally none.*

* *It assumes that coding is the goal. Software developers tend to be software addicts who think their job is to write code. But it's not. Their job is to solve problems. Don't celebrate the creation of code, celebrate the creation of solutions. We have way too many coders addicted to doing just one more line of code already.*

* *It puts the method before the problem. Before you go rushing out to learn to code, figure out what your problem actually is. Do you even have a problem? Can you explain it to others in a way they can understand? Have you researched the problem, and its possible solutions, deeply? Does coding solve that problem? Are you sure?*

*I suppose I can support learning a tiny bit about programming just so you can recognize what code is, and when code might be an appropriate way to approach a problem you have. But I can also recognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular training in the area. The general populace (and its political leadership) could probably benefit most of all from a basic understanding of how computers, and the Internet, work. Being able to get around on the Internet is becoming a basic life skill, and we should be worried about fixing that first and most of all, before we start jumping all the way into code.*

*Please don't advocate learning to code just for the sake of learning how to code.*

Many don't realize how important Snowden's **method **of leaking was.  There was a whistleblower 2010 - Thomas Drake - who didn't gather enough data to make it stop.  He works at the Genius bar now.  Snowden gathered enough evidence that it was incontrovertible, and leaked it in a way that didn't compromise ongoing legal intelligence activities.  

And he compromised his own life to do it.  He's absolutely a hero.

Bravo. I thoroughly agree with the Wilkerson, most especially including the reality of politics at all levels. It is always about power, though that is sometimes misleading as power shifts.

Editors:
"The whistle-blower himself says he has always been incredibly careful about what exactly he discloses, and to whom."

Please stop playing with words about what Snowden did.  He release *ALL* the documents he's ever going to release in one drop. He vetted them all at once. It was then up to Poitras and Greenwald to decide which order, and even whether, to release all the documents.

"always" implies he's still doing it. Which he's not, and hasn't been. Keep the facts straight, that's your job!

So he managed to film her entering a cheap motel with 2 guys and having sex with them both at the same time. My life is over. How can someone you trust do something like that? An illegal recording. I immediately quit being friends with him, and my wife is giving me all the support! Nobody will destroy my marriage!!"

These are hooks into a feature that application developers can turn on to allow for monitoring of their applications. This system is called Application Insights. Microsoft announced this during the 2015 Build Conference and is not a flashy announcement so I am guessing the media never even thought about it. This system has been around for website for several years and now they are extending it to allow for monitoring most types of applications. From an application developer stand point this is a wonderful because it can track user experience and tell developers how their app is getting used and where the problems might be. Ever get those annoying application errors that tick you off an make you want to uninstall an app? With these telemetry hooks developers can see the problem without you telling them. I use this for my websites and I love it.

4419 :: Microsoft slips user-tracking tools into Windows 7, 8 amidst Windows ...
App Insights is not a user-tracking tool. Jeez, its not hard to look it up. Its a service *used* by a ton of applications (including some Microsoft ones, and a great many others) to efficiently aggregate usage and diagnostic information. 

The App Insights system, to reduce load on the system, basically has a service that takes ETW logs and streams them into the application's AI instance. Its basically a local cache of data and a service to upload it, nothing more. 

What each user of it does with it is not some intrinsic evil in Windows, its what each application uses it for. I've got a few that solely use it, from a client standpoint, to report back exceptions. If AI wasn't available, I'd just be posting them up to a web endpoint like every other application out there.

Win10's client runtime includes AI support, and thus has the service pre-installed. Those runtime components are needed for backwards compatibility of newer applications onto older systems (just like having to install any of a hundred other Windows components like the MSVC runtime versions), thus the update installing it.

If nothing sends data to it, it doesn't do anything. And if any of the applications you're using need it, they'd be installing it themselves, anyway.

Interesting how the Gawker article tries to draw a parallel between Trump and Hillary about her email security. Are they trying to say that Donald's voicemails being hacked are just as bad as sending over 1800 classified emails over an unsecured network server? That's quite a stretch. I don't think Trump had any national secrets in his voice mail box - unless his discount code at Gucci is a national secret.

> The core of the criticism of Hillary Clinton’s private email server—a criticism Trump has repeated—is that her use of a private email server was an appalling and disqualifying security risk. With that in mind, it’s notable that, after Trump himself publicly broadcast this phone number, and urged his millions of Twitter followers to call it, he apparently didn’t delete the voicemails saved in this account’s inbox.

I'm sorry, what the hell are you talking about?

This is obviously not a phone that was used for any sensitive business matters. It's all meaningless personal messages from three years ago. We're not even in the same universe as sending top secret correspondence to an offsite e-mail server. 

Spinning this into some sort of "yeah, this is totally newsworthy and relevant" narrative feels like Gawker's trying to justify their use of Trump's phone number as clickbait, which led to this whole mess. His number wasn't newsworthy when they released it. They just thought it was a funny lark after he released Graham's. They got the clicks, Verizon fell victim to a very simple social engineering attack and Trump had some completely benign messages leaked. Turning it into anything other than that is a gigantic waste of everyone's time.

The issue with the courts isn't judges. It is lazy cops who think their accusation should be enough to put someone in jail and any breaking of law they might have done should be overlooked. Because of this lazy attitude, criminals walk and they walk all the time. Cops like to say they lost the case due to a "technicality" when the vast majority of those technicalities are simply a lazy officer who decided that the rules don't apply to them. If cops were actually competent at their jobs and even minimally educated in the laws they are supposed to enforce and the right of citizens (and aggressively disciplined when they violate those rights and laws. Every time. No matter what. There is no excuse for it), then we wouldn't see so many people walking on technicalities. It is a matter of effective oversight and discipline. Something that police forces are reluctant to do and powerful police unions oppose.  

If they are so incompetent that they fucked up a case against someone shooting a cop, then there is no way they should be in uniform at all.

> In Chicago, which has the country's second biggest fleet with roughly 7,000 taxis, the median sale price for a medallion hovered around $70,000 in 2007 before reaching a median sales peak of $357,000 in late 2013.
> 
> Since reaching that high point more than a year ago, the value of medallions in the Windy City have sharply declined and sales have ground to a near halt—with the city recording only seven medallion transfers in the first quarter of 2015—as the median sale price fell to about $270,000.

So they're still worth way more than they were in 2007 and people are complaining about it. It's almost like an investment in an artificially scarce market isn't a sure thing to increase in value every single year.

I come from a country that never regulated the number of taxis, just the qualifications of taxi drivers. The exam consists of "city topography " you need to know the streets, plus a psychological assessment, which is mostly directed at detecting aggressive behaviour, and done every two years. There's no fee other than the  administrative fee for the tests.

Guess what: nothing. Everything runs OK. There are lots of taxis , competition is high but not threatening the service quality, since the taxi drivers are not pressured to repay 270k. No serious complaints. Minor complaints are dealt with by taxi associations, which BTW do not own the cars, but deal only with marketing and dispatching.

I live in San Francisco, the taxi service is a joke. They won't drive to certain parts of the city if they don't feel like it, it used to take a 20 minute phone call to the rudest operators in the world to get a cab, if they even showed up, and if you complained nothing happened.

This just goes to show that if you can't give what consumers want, someone will. If anything, this is causation--not the horrific unwarranted plummeting of a global market share.

I mean, have you ever ridden in a taxi? It's fucking terrible, expensive, and it makes you question if your destination was important enough to warrant the trip.

Have you ever tried Uber, or other ridesharing services? Yea, they're pretty great. I call for them on my mobile phone. Pay for the ride before they even show up. Get to my destination--and be done with it. No cash, no assholes [because if there are, the parent company dishes out recompense], and the rides are pleasant. 

If anything we're viewing a new market devour an old one. Simple as that.

Although I agree Canada is in need of copy-write reform, this is a step in the wrong direction. Not only does this put power in the hands of big businesses but it makes Canadians targets for absurd copy-write infringement cases filed in other countries, including the United States. This will criminalize the poor majority. And say goodbye to the public domain. Life + 50 is ridiculous, but Life + 70? Everything our children will learn will be owned by someone. Big businesses don't need more protections. We need more competition to counter the worlds resources from pooling in the 1%, and that means less protections. A deal like this will divide Canada into social classes where only the rich, elite and privileged will have an opportunity to succeed. 

Governments are supposed to protect their citizens, not make them targets for other countries. And our laws should be a reflection of our values. The idea that a politician can even make decisions like these in secret is an affront to the democratic process.

Aside from Vietnam *(which only accounts for <1% of our exports)* those other countries aren't even in our Top 10 export partners.

Fuck this new philosophy of "job #1 is to protect the people." No it fucking isn't.

Fuck, even military service members swear to defend the Constitution first. Upholding the liberties described therein naturally leads to a defense policy which can effectively preserve liberties in the process.

As long as the safety of the people is pushed as job #1, protection of Consitutional liberties will be at best second-class citizens as tasks of government, and the talking heads will have an easy appeal to pathos to get more and more power at the expense of more and more liberties.

Would the American people support this ?

2) the government requires all new houses to have a video surveillance system installed by developers that allows the government to view video and listen to sound in any room.

Should the American people support this ?

If not then you are supporting terrorists who will use these vehicles and houses to plot and carry out attacks against the USA.

I think surveys like this suck. I wouldn't put sunlight at the top of my list because it's not the first thing that comes to mind because its obviously important and something we take for granted. Doesn't mean we don't value it, it just means its something he/she didn't think about at the time.

Let's see... survey was done by a blinds company. First red flag. 

Secondly, most people don't understand how these surveys work. When a poll that is sponsored by an organization is conducted, it rarely asks plainly whether you like A or B. What they do instead is they ask related questions to encourage the response they're seeking. 

For instance, a Republican poll wouldn't ask voters in a swing state whether they'd vote for Hillary or Trump. Instead, they ask what voters think about Hillary's track record in Benghazi, something which the majority of people don't have a clue about but have an opinion on. Then they ask whether Trump would make a difference in the White House. Obviously they know that since people know he's brash and tactless, people would view him as less prone to corruption. So you have a box checked against Hillary and another box checked for Trump. Get a majority of boxes checked in a "gerrymandered" category, and you can summarize it as people preferring Trump to Hillary. 

I'd bet my firstborn child that this is exactly the kind of shenanigans going in. Obviously the sponsor of the campaign has a vested interest in getting people to vote against daylight. Plus the margin is only 5%, 64% for daylight vs 69% for Internet. What's the standard deviation on that? 

Furthermore, there are other ways to get the result you want. What constitutes young people? An 18 year old living in an orphan's home who has never experienced Internet is a young person. A refugee father who has just immigrated from Syria is also a young person. 

I'd wager that the list of options they allow you to pick from is also grotesquely skewed; they probably deliberately included something nonsensical like radio controlled cars that they know people wouldn't pick and omit breathing for instance to raise the profile of the choices they were aiming for. 

I mean, just ask yourself. Would the normal, sane person pick Internet over everlasting darkness? It just doesn't make sense.

I agree that it's moronic, but the article does not really address *why* for the average layman.

A lot of people think (with good reason - after being brainwashed by the media) that "terrorists" are using "encryption" to terrorise us. This is always the reason against "encryption".

Of course the average person does not realize that they use encryption on a daily basis!

All the while we constantly read how <insert big company name here> has been "hacked" and that all of their customer details are being sold on the market... 

There is a disconnect in peoples minds between the term "encryption" and their own personal information security. How can I explain to my father in-law who thinks loyalty and credit cards are designed to spy on you and also believes "encryption" should be banned because of terrorists?

4366 :: Banning data encryption is “moronic”: Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
Encryption on the Internet is the technological equivalent of locks in the physical world. Banking, shopping and keeping your possessions save will not work without locks. 

That's all there is to it, encryption is a basic technology, just like locks.

Similarly it wouldn't make sense to require all locks to additionally open with one general key which thousands of government employees have access to. Of course that key would be copied within a short time and be available to criminals, and of course foreign secret services would try their hardest to get access to such a key. Which in turn provides access not just to your private pictures and correspondence, but also to trade secrets of private enterprises, and to any and all bank accounts. 
 
The result would be a disaster for the economy and for national security and that's not even considering that any actual criminals and terrorists of course continue to have access to working cryptography.

Now I wouldn't call anyone moronic for not understanding this. Nobody can know everything. However if you formulate policy for a major political party, and it doesn't even occur to you *once* to consult some actual experts on the topic ... well, then you are a moron.

It's also impossible.  encrypt a file, get a text string output. Even trivial analysis code can see it's encrypted.  Use the file as a long string of rgb triplets to build a .png "image". Send the image instead of the encrypted file.  OR  
Use the file as the key for caeser cypher, encoding Moby Dick by H. Melville.  Send Moby Dick instead of the encrypted file.  
Etc.  This does even take into account different langauge encodings. There's an infinite number of ways to obfuscate encrypted text to conceal that encryption was used.   
Inb4 "security thru obscurity doesn't work". Obscurity PLUS security can work, it's just an endless arms race that govt could never win.

A single company should not be allowed to offer cable and Internet, it's a conflict of interests which is preventing America from keeping up with technology.

4358 :: Is Comcast’s new Stream TV service as bad as it seems for net neutral...
There's no "getting around" here, no exploring. The FCC explicitly allowed this kind of thing because it's the same kind of service as PPV always has been.

Coax-based systems (HFC) are going to transition away from having 6 MHz TV channels and just go to packet video. This will start next year with DOCSIS 3.1. If they are not allowed to do this it will cause their systems to be slower and less money efficient than they otherwise would be. This is going to cost the cable operators money which will cost us money because they don't eat costs, they pass them on to customers.

This kind of change it just a change to reserving a different kind of bandwidth within their system for TV usage than they did before. It doesn't turn it into an internet service because it doesn't go to or from the internet it's not some kind of massive cheat in that way. Its just another way of using their system to deliver TV.

I do wish the FCC would have put in some consideration that ISPs should be required to allow other video providers to colocate in their datacenters and thus also be outside caps/tiers. Although I guess by allowing zero rating they did that in a very basic way, just didn't put in any regulations or guidelines to mandate it.

4358 :: Is Comcast’s new Stream TV service as bad as it seems for net neutral...
This is only a problem if they are lying about what they are doing.  If they are truly just using their own infrastructure and not routing through the internet, then they are basically just bringing cable TV into the 21st century.  And it's clever on their part.    
    
But, if they are lying, then all we need are some clever individuals to prove such.     
     
Let's look at the glass half full for a moment.  Perhaps if they are telling the truth this will push the conversation about how/why it is that Comcast "owns" infrastructure that is often subsidized or paid for by tax payers?  I mean, they are basically admitting to owning a single network that spans the entire country that can deliver content without having to route through a single non-Comcast server.  
     
Also, what happens when Verizon or Time Warner decide to start offering similar services over the same wires?  How can the argument hold up?

If as many people took up the cause against this as SOPA/PIPA we might get somewhere. Even if they're not your provider, file a complaint to add your voice (I did).

E: Basic submission letter below. Not the best, so hopefully someone can fix it up for me.

Dear Tom Wheeler - 

I applaud your recent efforts to further Net Neutrality and provider a level playing field for both service providers and consumers.  In line with the plan you outlined there, I would like to bring your attention (and hopefully your ire) to Comcast's recently announced "Stream TV". "Stream TV" is Comcast's IP TV service, and they have recently confirmed to the media that it will not count against Comcast's data caps. By definition, this is information not being treated equally, and is directly against the tenets of Net Neutrality. Please take action by ensuring that all IP TV sent over Comcast's network does not count against any providers data caps. This is the best way to encourage and foster innovation and opportunity.

Thanks

I don't understand why this isn't an anti-trust lawsuit ripe and ready for the filing. They are leveraging one part of their business to force you to use another part of their business. Since many areas don't have competitive choice over their ISP, you're forced to use their streaming service and avoid Netflix so you don't bust through the data cap and pay overages. They can't force Netflix to pay them or force you to pay more for Netflix, so instead they're just going to set a data cap make THEIR streaming service not subject to that cap. This is how they'll bypass net neutrality on their network. By making you pay extra to stream from non-Comcast sources.

Copy of the news article in case Reddit breaks it with the hug of death, the website is blocked for you, etc...: 


>**In China, Your Credit Score Is Now Affected By Your Political Opinions – And Your Friends’ Political Opinions:**

>China just introduced a universal credit score, where everybody is measured as a number between 350 and 950. But this credit score isn’t just affected by how well you manage credit – it also reflects how well your political opinions are in line with Chinese official opinions, and whether your friends’ are, too.

>In the West, the surveillance agencies have been trying to stay as low-key as possible, while listening to everything and anything. China has taken a different approach. Not only is the surveillance very overt, you are also constantly nudged to fall in line.

>This Chinese credit score, which seemed innocent at first, was introduced this summer. More precisely, it was introduced by Alibaba and Tencent, China’s IT giants who run the Chinese equivalents of all social networks, and who therefore have any and all data about you. People can download an app named “Sesame Credit” from the Alibaba network, and the score has become something of a bragging contest, being interpreted as a kind of “citizen status” – and not entirely falsely so. Almost 100,000 people have posted their “status” online on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

>[Sesame Credit Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nx06uPZ.jpg)

>A screenshot from the Sesame Credit app, showing score 698 on a scale from 350 to 950.In the West, our credit score is simple. It’s our ability to pay. It’s measured from our assets, our income, and if we have bought on credit in the past and managed it well. That’s it. In China, the situation is… more nuanced. It’s not just that you have bought things, it’s also what you buy that contribute to your credit score, in either direction. If you’re buying things that the regime appreciates, like dishwashers and baby supplies, your credit score increases. If you’re buying videogames, your score takes a negative hit.

>Anybody can check anybody’s credit score using the site Credit China, which again helps people disconnect from people who significantly draw down your own credit score: they’re listed as such. All 869,582 of them.

>In theory, Sesame Credit (and its benefits) is optional. So far. For the time being. But China has already announced that it, or something very like it, will become mandatory from 2020. It has also announced that while there are benefits today for obedient people, it intends to add various sanctions for people who don’t behave, like limited Internet connectivity. Such people will also be barred from serving in certain high-status and influential positions, like government official, reporter, CEO, statistician, and similar.

>Things that will make your score deteriorate include [posting political opinions without prior permission](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/us-china-internet-idUSKBN0KM1F320150113), talking about or describing a [different history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989) than the official one, or even publishing [accurate up-to-date news](http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/investing/china-arrests-markets-crash/) from the Shanghai stock market collapse (which was and is embarrassing to the Chinese regime).

>But the kicker is that if any of your friends do this — publish opinions without prior permission, or report accurate but embarrassing news — your score will also deteriorate. And this will have a direct impact on your quality of life.

>“Sesame Credit, however, also uses other data to calculate the scores, such as a person’s hobbies, interaction with friends, shopping habits and lifestyle.” — Quote from China Daily Asia

>The KGB and the Stasi’s method of preventing dissent from taking hold was to plant so-called agents provocateurs in the general population, people who tried to make people agree with dissent, but who actually were after arresting them as soon as they agreed with such dissent. As a result, nobody would dare agree that the government did anything bad, and this was very effective in preventing any large-scale resistance from taking hold. The Chinese way here is much more subtle, but probably more effective still.

>This scheme is far more sinister than it seems at first, as you’re also getting assorted immediate privileges based on this credit score:

>If your credit score reaches 600, you have the privilege of an instant loan of about $800 without collateral when shopping online.

>At a score of 650, you may rent a car without leaving a deposit.

>At 700, you get access to a bureaucratic fast track to a Singapore travel permit.

>And at 750, you get a similar fast track to a coveted Schengen visa.

>There are many more examples – these are just to illustrate.

>Do you see what’s happening here? This means that people need to choose between that coveted European vacation and keeping in touch with their old friends who are disagreeing with the regime’s opinions openly. This means that staying in touch with dissidents will cause you and your family to lose out on social benefits. As a result, this will very effectively isolate and neuter anybody who posts unofficial political opinions or unofficial history facts. They’ll effectively be sent into social exile, based on everything they do, write, think, and discuss online.

>What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking. This may not be the purpose, indeed I doubt it’s the primary purpose, but it’s nevertheless the effect of giving only obedient people the social ability to have children, not to mention successful children.

>People sometimes mock the notion that we’re not at a 1984 level yet. I wonder what it’ll really take to make such people realize that the 1984 point of surveillance has long come and gone.

I feel like people with better credit have more access to money, therefore more access to opportunity and success. Example, school loan, starting a business, that impressive car or house. These can be stepping stones to make more money, attract a better mate, or have more kids (which is a different issue in china). But what I feel like this all boils down to, is social cleansing. Basically people that don't agree with the prefer social ideas, won't be successful and have kids or money to get through tough times.

While I agree that the law should be scrutinized and reviewed, this article description of the laws age isn't completely accurate. A quick Wikipedia search reveals that the law in its current form was originally passed in 1911, and has been amended several times since then. I don't like that the organizations that are supposed to be the "good guys" feel the need to stretch the truth for their cause. It's the same argument that republicans use against the FCCs classification of broadband as a utility. Yeah, it's factual, but the implication is misleading.

I stopped reading at this: “Our business model is not based around moving a car out of the dealer,” Sampson said. “We envision this like a smart phone. The revenue starts once you get the device in the owners’ hands. We’re looking at subscriptions and apps and other opportunities.”

Good luck with that.

I'm at 50gb so far this month with 4 days left on my billing cycle. I've seen my speed drop down to 3g many times, when downloading things.

4325 :: Scientists accidentally create batteries that last a lifetime
The actual thing in the paper is a pseudocapacitor, not a battery...  It can cycle for a long time, but the actual amount of energy stored is quite low.  Saying we can use the same tech to make batteries that last a long time is speculation.

Also, from the plot, it's not that good of a pseudocapacitor?  50 F/g capacitance is lower than you would get for many double layer capacitors, which already can achieve very long cycle lives.  There are pseudocapacitors out there that get over 10x higher capacitance - that higher capacitance is the whole reason to make a pseudocapacitor (though the energy density is still well below that of batteries).

Edit: Just going to add this for those not too familiar with the topic....  A simple description of the difference between a battery, an electric double-layer capacitor, and a pseudocapacitor is that a battery has charge-transfer reactions occurring deep within the electrode materials used, a double-layer capacitor has no charge-transfer reactions occurring (charges just "stick" to the surface), and a pseudocapacitor has both charge-transfer reactions at the surface of the material and charges "sticking" to the surface.  In general, the less you mess with the material, the longer it lasts (since you're not constantly shifting stuff into or out of it, and thus as giving it fewer chances to break) and the more power you can get from it (since it's easier to move stuff from a surface than it is to move stuff from deep inside a material).  However, at the same time, you can store less energy because you're just utilizing the surface and not the surface plus the interior.  I would generally think of pseudocapacitors as sort of a "compromise technology" that gives up some of the lifespan of double-layer capacitors in order to reach higher energy densities.

Also, I'm not saying this paper is bad research or anything.  It's cool how much they've extended the cycle life, and it's possible that similar techniques might be applied to higher-capacity systems to enable longer cycle lives.  It's just important to keep in mind that the actual research and what's in the hyped-up article about the research are different things.

Edit #2: I'll also note (having realized that the paper is actually open-access - I had assumed at first that it was not available, since I'm not currently somewhere with journal access) that it looks like the capacity at lower scan rates (more or less translating to, at lower currents) is not so much lower than normal as I'd initially believed.  Generally people include the highest capacity value achieved during their tests in their abstract or front plot, but these folks did not.

I also dislike the use of "accidentally" in this article. The grad student Mya purposefully applied a gel layer and purposefully tested it. It was not an accident, it was just experimenting. That's kind of how science works. The fact that her discovery wasn't well-motivated doesn't make it an accident.

4317 :: AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable Implicated In Content Delivery Netwo...
This is a peering dispute. Let's break down AT&T statement:

> “It would be unprecedented and unjustified to force AT&T to provide free backbone services to other backbone carriers and edge providers, as Cogent et al seek,”

I suspect, if we saw enough of the details, that this would look a lot like the Verizon / Level 3 peering dispute. If so, there's no seeking of free backbone services. GTT is merely attempting to deliver data requested by AT&T customers and AT&T is refusing it. Two obvious reasons to do that would be to attempt to get paid twice for that traffic and to hurt competing services (video that competes with their own TV service).

> “Nor is there any basis for requiring AT&T to augment network capacity for free and without any limits."

AT&T should not sell 10 Mbps service if it refuses to augment its network enough to provide that service. That's Internet service provider 101 - don't sell more capacity than you can provide.

> Opponents’ proposals would shift the costs of their services onto all AT&T subscribers, many of whom do not use Opponents’ services, and would harm consumers.”

It's AT&T that is attempting to shift the cost of their network to other companies on the Internet. When GTT has an increase in traffic on their backbone or at a peering point, they increase the bandwidth at the congested point. AT&T should do that same. And if AT&T doesn't think it fair that light users pay the same as heavy users, they're arguing against their own pricing policy.

4317 :: AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable Implicated In Content Delivery Netwo...
> There is no precedent...

Yes there is. The entire internet is the fucking precedent.

There will always be sides that have to offer more data than they are receiving. But to the people interacting with said services, that is exactly as expected. Webservers in general have put out more data than they have received since the dawn of time. Same with newsgroups and bulletin boards.

In the end, you have customers that pay you expecting to give them **unhindered internet access**. If you do not expand your ability to provide said access, you are not living up to your side of the contract. Worse, you want to receive _more_ money.

This situation can be easily compared to simple infrastructure. Suppose business is booming in a neighboring town, but the majority of people live in your own. This causes a lot of traffic. NeighborTown is really happy with the money that's flowing in, but ThisTown is seeing precious tax dollars escaping them. To incentivize businesses to move to their town instead, they make it really had for the employees to do their daily traveling by actively blocking proposals to widen the roads and otherwise improve infrastructure. The people who are really the victims of this are **the people living in ThisTown**. They have to wake up earlier for traffic and go home later. They may lose their jobs when YetAnotherTown can provide a workforce that can service NeighborTown more adequately. They may be forced to move to make things meet, giving up on their dreamhouse.

Worst of all, **ThisTown is supposed to have the best interests of its citizens at heart**.

This shit is screwed up. If you provide infrastructure, you aim to meet the everyones needs. That is your job, and if you think that your own profits have become too important to do the job you are supposed to make your living with, then you are too fucking big, and need to be castrated by government before your mentality gets the entire fucking industry pregnant on hormones.

I'm done ranting, move on.

I just canceled my Comcast due to their terrible customer service.

When I first signed up I had intermittent outages constantly.  Took 3 trips from service people to finally have someone who knew enough about their tech to replace the box, as the first one was an old model that couldn't support 100 mbps.

This month I was overcharged by $141.00 and that money was "credited" back into my account.  This "credit" can only be refunded at the next billing cycle in January, and then would take an additional 4-6 weeks to reach me.  

I called for an explanation, but noone could give me one. 

I asked for an expedited refund and was put on hold for 45 mins.

Called back and just asked to cancel my subscription, they rep told me that they could offer me Starz if I wouldn't cancel.  Told her I wasn't interested, just cancel me at the end of the month.

She tells me my service will end on Jan 2, and she processed the termination.

I call back the next day to confirm the cancellation (I know this game). 

She straight up lied to me and I am still subscribed.

Email the FCC and BBB and file a report.  Comcast reaches back out to me and I am finally going to be canceled at the end of the month.

Worst customer service I have ever seen.  I am switching to RCN

I love the response he has to the data cap question. 

>It doesn't effect 95% of the population, and pricing is fair.

False. You gave us a contract for data at a certain speed. There was no cap on it. Now you're changing your policy, prices aren't being reduced, and we get a worse product out of it. How is this good for the customer, and how is this fair?

Also, the reason I hate Comcast is because of the bullshit limitations on their products. Want to watch a show on the computer? Oops, sorry, thats only available on TV. Want to watch a football game that's on in Pittsburgh, but not on in Baltimore? Sorry, can't do it. You wanna know why people are moving away from cable? It's because the system is designed to be overly profitable for the broadcast companies, overly profitable for the cable company, and designed to fuck the consumer in the ass. We get a shit product that we shouldn't be settling for, all because we have no other option, and we're too fucking addicted to consumerism to do anything about it. 

These assholes force out smaller, better cable companies all because they aren't playing the role of cash grab whores that the big names are playing. That's why they're so fucking scared of Google fiber. Brian mentions Google is free in his "the customers are wrong" rant, but he forgot to mention Google Fiber. That's doing it properly. They blatantly lie to their customers, attempt to sell them shit they don't need, and force them into these "bundle" packages that are designed to hide the shit they don't need to suck more money out of a product that shouldn't cost nearly what they charge. Oh, you're going to offer me a triple play package? But you're going to drop my bandwidth speed from 120 mbps to 25 mbps? And drop my already despicably low upload speed from 10 to 5? But you're giving me free long distance calls, so I guess it's worth charging me $25 extra for it! It's fucking pathetic what we put up with!

If they gave me bandwidth speeds that didn't suck satan's dick for the price they charge me, I would be all for it. But we are now in 2015, and I still have a 10 mbps upload speed. That is embarrassing. They should feel embarrassed by the product they sell. But they don't. And that's how you can tell they don't give a fuck about their customers. They're more than content trying to sell you "triple play" over and over and over every year on a "promotional" plan in an attempt to drop your overall bandwidth in the hope that you won't notice, and give you a fucking landline phone in the process. Because we have definitely needed those in the market in the last 5 years.

4312 :: "Stanford researchers have developed the first lithium-ion battery th...
The important distinction is that they came up with thermal protection that cuts off power at the electrodes inside of the cells.   

Li-ion/po batteries are almost always used with thermal cut-offs, temperature sensors, and similar protections.  These work fine until the failure happens inside of the battery cells themselves.

For example on of the massive laptop battery recalls was due to a manufacturing defect that allowed the batteries to develop internal shorts in between the layers inside of the cell.  Laptop batteries have at least two separate redundant protection systems.  These didn't stop the fires because the failure happened inside of the cells.

Their invention is to coat the electrodes with a nano material that will turn from a conductor into an insulator when heated.  This cuts off the electron flow at the electrodes inside of the battery to stop thermal run away.  This is great and it will solve the problem of internal cell failures leading to fires.

My only thought on this technology is that you really don't want it to reset.  If a system is designed and operating correctly this condition should never happen outside of catastrophic failure.  If a catastrophic failure happens the system should stay offline until repaired and not cycling between protect mode and catastrophic failure until the protections or something else fails.

I was 16 when 9/11 happened. It's been a complete shit show since then. I've lost the hope of the Dream I was taught. I have no hope that things will improve. I'm so fucking glad I didn't go fight in the wars. I idealized our "cause", was just as Patriotic as I am now, and those war drums were beating loudly as an 18 year old. Things have really fucking changed in the last 14 years, for us as a country, and for myself personally. It's so depressing to have no trust or faith in our leaders.

To those claiming a polarizing filter does exactly the same thing, check out the video /u/optagon posted. This technique can extract the reflection-free image as well as the reflection itself. Additionally, you can do this in post processing in case you forgot to bring your polarizing filter or are using a smartphone. Also filters reduce incoming light and other things photographers can tell you about.

4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
It's worth noting here that FedEx and UPS have both raised their prices and fuel surcharges in the last few months. While I'm sure Amazon wants to increase prime subscriptions, these changes must also affect their decision. 
831
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
Every business step Amazon takes, is to increase its Prime subscription. Their main goal is economies of scale (in *everything* they do). Its a simple but brilliant business model. 
1454
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
I remember hearing on Marketplace Tech (I think) that Amazon actually paid out of pocket something close to $1 billion on shipping costs in the last quarter of 2015. Not surprised they're raising the limit again.
122
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
It's an overlooked feature that I don't think a lot of people know about so I'll go ahead and post it. 

Amazon prime can be shared between accounts. You can link your account to 1 person who has amazon prime. Even though only 1 has paid for it, both get 2 day shipping and movie subscription. So if you happen to know someone else with Amazon prime, you can link accounts and split the 99 dollar fee. Each person maintains their own log in and payment methods/addresses.

It's a bit of a pain to figure out, but once it is set up, you don't have to fuss with it at all. Just make sure when you link accounts to ensure you unmark the box that asks if you would like to share payment methods for both accounts if you don't want to do that. 
63
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
As a Prime member, I don't mind paying for the $99 membership per year.  My wife and I order a lot from Amazon, and the membership pays for itself in the first few months in what we save in shipping costs, not to mention the convenience of having 2 day shipping on Prime items and low cost next day.
387
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
I almost cancelled prime last year at the rate hike. Tired of them adding services that I don't use or care about and then charging more...

But I always end up sticking around due to their customer service. Im pretty much getting hosed right now on a mint condition (no scratches at all, full packaging and accessories) iPhone 5s through their scam trad-in service (it's being returned to me due to Major dents or scratches). Im afraid to see what phone they are returning and claiming to be mine. Amazon offered to credit me the full price of the trade in if it does arrive damaged or swapped for some shit phone. 

Also can't even count the number of items they took back that were defective or not right and covered the return shipping. Simply the best return policy i've ever encountered.
132
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
This means I will shift more of my orders for sub - $49 items to competing services.
233
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
I guess I will be buying even less from amazon now. I live in a state where they charge tax for amazon products. On top of that I can usually get the same item cheaper without tax and free shipping from an ebay seller. Still a good site for reviews though.
8
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
It's not only the price, it's the time it takes them to actually ship stuff. Just had an order that shipped 5 days!! after the order was placed for in-stock amazon-fulfilled items.
Also did you encounter prime-only items? What the fuck amazon? Seriously? Or ads in search results?
More I use them.. more I realize that competition is important. /rant
97
4297 :: Amazon pushes its free shipping minimum to $49
Typical, a big online retailer offers low-entrance free shipping to strangle out smaller retailers out of the game, and then when the market is secured, they raise their minimum cart prices. That's why you should always prefer smaller retailers over big ones, all things considered.

Statistics are more meaningful when there's something to compare it to.  Is having 12 minor accidents per 1 million miles a lot or a little, when we compare the study group (autonomous vehicles) to the control group (human drivers)? 

First, we go to NHTSA for some data : http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812032.pdf

Here it says, in 2012, in the U.S., there were 3 trillion vehicle-miles driven, and 5.6 million accidents reported to the police.    

That comes out to 1.86 accidents per million miles.

So, let's look at the hypothesis that "Google self-driven cars are no more or less safe than self-driven cars".  

In other words, a bunch of average American driver racking up a total of a  million miles is "expected" to be involved in about 2 accidents.  This is not much different from Google.

Somebody taking a statistics class can fill in the details.

4269 :: Tech leaders give $5 million to build 100 new SF apartments to house ...
Let's be clear about what's going on here.  Hint:  it's not a project to build 100 new SF apartments to house homeless veterans.

The Mission Rock initiative is a $1.6 billion development planned for 22 acres of currently undeveloped waterfront property south of the Giants' stadium.  The plan includes 1-2 million square feet of commercial space (including a new Anchor brewery on Pier 48), 8 acres of open space, and up to 1500 residential units.

The residential portion of the project is projected to cost about $50 million, which is about 3% of the total development cost.  Those residential units will be in two 240' tall high-rise towers that will occupy the northeast and southeast corners of the land.

The Giants are trying to get a measure onto the November ballot to approve this project, which otherwise will encounter a number of significant obstacles, notably the city's height limitations on waterfront development, and SF activists' opposition to developments that don't include adequate below-market housing.

To be a little less objective:

The deal you're reading about today is part of this political campaign, as is the glossy full-color mailer I received yesterday extolling the virtues of the project.  

Given the scale of the development, the amount of land and resources allocated to housing seems absurdly low to me.  It will make the Giants a ton of money, to be sure, but the project would certainly be profitable if they doubled or tripled the amount of housing it included.  (Indeed, if you look at the history of this project, the number of residential units keeps nosing up as the plan's backers try to find a palatable number.  Pricey though residential real estate in SF may be, commercial real estate on the waterfront is solid gold.  They'd build this 100% commercial if they could.)

Does SF need a new huge commercial development?  Well...kinda.  Commercial real estate is in short supply here, what with the tech boom and all.  But for the next decade or two, the city needs development that's heavy on residential and light on commercial, not the other way around.  Increasing the ratio of commercial to residential in SF just makes the city's problems worse.

The other thing to pay attention to here is the amount of money involved in the development:  $1.6 billion.  Do not expect that money to be spent transparently, and expect the entire board of supervisors to support the initiative sooner or later.

**Edit:**  Oh, in the context of this, consider what a master stroke it is to get philanthropists to give you $5 million to cover the costs of something that you were going to need to build anyway.

san fran has a substantial homeless problem for those who haven't lived or traveled there.  you walk around the main squares and the place is crawling with a plethora of interesting people, sometimes good, sometimes a bit frightening.  the problems come in with some of the homeless, of whom some appear to be schizophrenic and some probably psychopaths (in the literal, non-judgmental definition (no empathy)).  It's a pronounced experience if you haven't been, hundreds of homeless are just off the main drags.  I have been rushed by a guy in army fatigues with a 5 inch blade only to be stopped by a bit of quick de-escalation and a friend who was carrying (plain cloths) and other police that moved in quickly.  the guy backed down but he meant serious business with a few tense moments.  this was at one of the fire-dance events, a monthly event that draws hundreds.  not fun to have an insane person rushing at you in the midst of music, lights, fire, etc at 10pm, fearing for your life in a main square.

this is a nice gesture by the execs but it's really a larger problem.  part of the issue is SF's temperate climate; it's quite lovely most of the year.  you can comfortably live outside, translation: many of the streets reek of urine and nothing's changed in a while.  I feel more comfortable in most parts of NYC than many of the wonderful sub-districts of SF (i trust nyc's more and no the limits there / sf i am often surprised block to block).  I usually carry a proDSLR when walking, and having been to SF many times for meetings, the preponderance of people on the street who watch you carefully has made me nervous.  Especially at night, i've found this to be true.  

So, nice move but self-interested in a way as SF is base for many a tech conference, and there's quite a bit of disparity between main streets and side ones in 'safety' feel.  unfortunately, income disparity, homeless, drug-use, probably a complex problem with no simple solution.  few thoughts.  hopefully more capital will be raised to help those in need in and around the city.

The problem with homelessness in SF is not simply that there are people who don't have homes.

"Homeless" is code for woefully incapacitated people who cannot function without around-the-clock intervention.

I had credits to Ashley Madison at one point in my life.  I'm almost 100% sure there are no women on that site.  The way it's set up is you have to spend credits for everything, even reading messages.  You would (conveniently) receive messages from very attractive women when you're out of credits.  When you re-up and respond they never respond back, and all the women seem to disappear.  Don't worry, they come back when you're out of credits again.

In Apple's new iOS 9 you have to accept their terms and conditions which state that if you turn on any of the location services (GPS) on the phone, they have the right to collect your location and the places you visit, when you visit those places and how often and sell that information to whomever they choose.  If you don't turn on the location services and you have an emergency while on the road, 911 cannot find you.  

It's total bullshit.  I pay good money every month to use that phone but I now have to relinquish my personal privacy to the highest bidder??? 

This is utterly unacceptable.  

Google does the same  thing with their WAZE GPS program.  WAZE collects all your travel info, keeps a profile on your travel habits, predicts where you'll go on certain days, collects the names and phone numbers in your contact list and keeps a record of that information which Google can use or sell as they see if.  

WHY FUCK would this ever be acceptable anywhere on the planet?  

This sort of personal data collection would give the old East German government wet dreams.   

What astonishes me is the little weasels that always argue this is okay and to just not use that feature/service etc.  Well not being able to be found if I have a heart attack and collapse before I can tell the 911 operator where I am is an unacceptable risk to take to protect my privacy.

While I generally agree, it should be noted that I've seen some incredibly good phishing attempts.  Particularly spear-phishing attempts.

I won't comment on the employees failing simle phishing tests but as the end of the article points out these types of attacks are getting more and more complex, to the point where training really is only going to do so much good.

For end users it's not as serious, but If you hold administrative privileges on a DoD system and you fall for phishing attempts, you should lose your administrative credentials. If you work in IT, there's no excuse for falling for this sort of thing.

Also, with the widespread use of CAC logon, the old username/password problem doesn't really exist for most DoD systems. Attackers getting their hands on the credentials in a smart card would be pretty hard indeed.

Bahahaha. I work at a financial institution, and we have a similar testing program going on that's trying to "train" people to recognize phishing attempts. They send out emails with phishing cues, then send out the results and tell people how to recognize phishing, like hovering over links and such. 

The tests have started out super obvious - as in, subject line "This is phishing" obvious - and have gotten only somewhat less obvious, like links that go to www.thisisphishing.com. The goal is to get 100% success at recognizing phishing.

We're at something like 94%, but apparently there's a handful of people with special needs who fall for every single one. Every single one. Got an order from "Ebay" on your work PC? or an "Amazon" order? Or maybe an email from President Obama, asking you to donate? #Iclickeverytime

It not only makes me wonder how gullible these guys are, I wonder what the hell they're doing all day at work.

I'll take the person sending the phishing emails at face value. He says the emails “look blatantly to be coming from outside of DHS — to any security practitioner, they’re blatant”. 

If they really were that obvious then there is no excuse. There is no other professional tool I know of that people can claim so much ignorance as with computer software. If I say "I did not know the circular saw would hurt" on a shop, or "I did not know natural gas would catch fire" on an oil platform, I'd be fired on the spot.

i do not understand how people fail these tests

our company has mandatory privacy training, which i've faked taking for a year now, because it's literally stupid bullshit like DON'T SEND CUSTOMERS' BANK INFO IN PRIVATE EMAILS TO RANDOM PEOPLE WHO SOLICIT IT

then they have tests

know what those tests are?

they tell you in advance "yo this week we're gonna be sending out sneaky emails soliciting shit, if you reply u dun fired"

so they send out the most obvious emails ever 

AND WITHOUT FAIL PEOPLE RESPOND TO THEM 

like

people respond to these company test emails soliciting shit like social security numbers, and then as if to add insult to injury they REPLY ALL and send that info to the entire damn company

I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS, let alone wake up every morning and walk out their front door without spending six hours trying to operate a door knob

A key bit of context here: Katehi has caught a lot of shit recently about holding board positions for a textbook company (Wiley) and a for-profit university under legal investigation (DeVry). She was receiving as much as her entire paycheck from UC Davis for holding them (nearly $450,000 as chancellor and another ~$450,000 through board positions). She's been defending herself for about a month now from legislators, faculty, and students (currently occupying the administration building).

http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article63917982.html

The Sac Bee was among the first to report these positions she held, and this investigation ostensibly comes from digging up unsavory bits of Katehi's past.

Katehi might think it was a good idea to spend $175,000 of California taxpayers money on an SEO company to try to bury search results about UC Davis campus police pepper spraying protestors, but really, UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi should have known that UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi's attempt to hide search results about UC Davis campus police pepper spraying protestors by spending $175,000 of California taxpayers' money would only end up drawing more attention to UC Davis campus police pepper spraying protestors and Linda P.B. Katehi's attempts to hide it. Frankly, I had completely forgotten about UC Davis campus police pepper spraying protestors until this article about UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B.

4201 :: Yahoo settles e-mail privacy class-action: $4M for lawyers, $0 for users
This is a click-bait headline meant to tap into society's misplaced hatred for lawyers.  There's nothing nefarious here.  These lawyers corrected a wrong that would 've otherwise gone unaddressed.

On oversimplistic example might help: Let's assume that an evil cable company (you all know who I mean) has figured out some bullshit fee that they're adding into your monthly bill.  It isn't much -- let's say $0.33/month.  Over a year that's only $4.  Not a single one of you is going to go hire a $500/hour lawyer to recover the four bucks, but the overbilling nets hundred of millions for the cable company after a few years.

Enter the class action lawyers.  They pay all of the costs of proving the wrongdoing.  They build the logistics of notifying the class and filing the suit, and they roll the dice that the cable company might win.  At the end of the day, they've stopped the wrongdoing of the cable company, everyone gets a bill credit, and the lawyers get to split a big fee.

Its not a perfect solution, but its the best one we have.  In this Yahoo case, the monetary damages weren't the point - stopping the email privacy problem was.  These lawyers did the work, but if no one is getting a cash award, how do you compensate the lawyers? You get Yahoo to pay them as a part of their agreement.

4201 :: Yahoo settles e-mail privacy class-action: $4M for lawyers, $0 for users
Lawyer here:

I'm not here to defend *this* particular settlement, but the reason it settled for so little is right there in the article. I won't get into the nuances of class actions, but there are two things you must know:

1. Until a class is certified (by the court; a class can only be certified if it meets certain standards), it is only a putative class action. Before a class is certified, the case is whoever the named plaintiffs are against the Defendant (an "individual case").

2. Many types of violations are not viable to bring as individual cases, which is why attorneys bring them as class case. For example, 20 million people defrauded out of $1 each. Suing over $1 for one person is not viable. Suing over $20m as a class of 20m people is viable.

On to why this settled like it did:

>Google has faced similar claims over Gmail scanning. Koh also oversaw that case but denied class certification to the plaintiffs. After the 9th Circuit upheld Koh's ruling, the case settled in less than two weeks.

The 9th Circuit upheld Koh's ruling in mid-2014. This case against Yahoo was filed in 2013. 

So, basically, here's what happened:

2013: Plaintiff's counsel: "That case against Gmail looks good. I hear Yahoo is doing the same thing. Let's sue them."

2014: Plaintiff's counsel: "Shit, class cert denied in case against Gmail. By the same judge we have. Not good."

One day later: Yahoo's counsel: "So, plaintiffs counsel, we defeated a motion for class cert on nearly identical facts in front of this same judge. That's likely going to happen here. We can settle now, throw some money at you and make changes to our policies, or we can fight, defeat your motion for class cert, and give nobody anything."

Put simply: the case looked good when filed, but it went awry when the judge who had these cases sided with defendants on class certification.

Yahoo was never going to pay the class any money once class cert was denied in Gmail. While it's easy to ask a lawyer to fall on his or her sword and take no money if the class recovers no money, such a decision could be absolutely devastating to a law firm. Not saying that's what happened here, but I have seen it happen (more along the lines of a lawyer losing a big class case and nearly, or actually, going under).

Of course, it's conceivable that the lawyers could have said "Nay! Take that $4m and give it to the class!" But I don't think Yahoo would have done that. Paying the class is a lot more expensive (costs of providing notice to the class, actually disbursing the checks) than paying a lawyer in one check. Notice costs can go well into the millions.

It's also important to remember that no one lawyer is walking out of here with $4m. While only two firms are listed, I'm sure there were dozens of attorneys and other firms involved.

Anyway, my point isn't that this is a good settlement. It's a bad settlement when looked at in a vacuum. But Judge Koh's ruling in gmail sapped Plaintiff of virtually all of its leverage. Under the circumstances, there likely wasn't much more that could be done.

ETA: Also, the settlement must be approved by the court. And if you're a class member and you think it's a bad settlement, you can literally go to court and object to the settlement.
39
4201 :: Yahoo settles e-mail privacy class-action: $4M for lawyers, $0 for users
$0 for users, but an award of $5,000 for each of the class representatives/named plaintiffs. So technically he individuals who did all the work will walk away with some money. Also, yahoo did agree to non-monetary conditions which, given the abstract nature of the alleged injury in this case, is probably about as much as could be expected. Good deal for named plaintiffs and a great deal for their attorneys.

Incredibly misleading headline to try to make good lawyers look bad. Article tries to make it appear that the lawyers took all of the settlement money for themselves, and took that money directly out of their clients' hands. Not true. There was no money available to the class members, the lawyers did not take their money. The lawyers are getting paid for doing all of the work and paying all the costs out of their pocket.
4
4201 :: Yahoo settles e-mail privacy class-action: $4M for lawyers, $0 for users
Yes, that's how class action works. Without it, the common civilian has no reasonable recourse to right wrongs perpetrated by huge powerful entities.  Even if people don't get full compensation, it is a mechanism to protect the lower and middle class. 

(Unfortunately SCOTUS has made it legal to allow these companies to write away a person's right to take part in class action suits, even when the company holds a territorial monopoly. Pretty much cementing a two tier legal system for people who can afford expensive legal representation and those who can't.)

4184 :: Indian Patent Office Says No to Software Patents
This sounds quite similar to the European approach. 

In Europe, only computer programs that have a technical effect *beyond* the normal operation of a computer (i.e. reading/writing memory, displaying images, processing data) can be patented. So a control program for a robot that enables it to hop on one leg is probably not excluded, nor is a system for calculating how rapidly to pulse brakes in ABS.

4184 :: Indian Patent Office Says No to Software Patents
Another thing on  a different front of healthcare patents, which does not align with the global pharma companies, is how Indian patent law has been opposed to granting patents unless the applicant can show substantial improvement in drug efficacy, thereby nullifying or rejecting many applications wherein only a minor rejig of the drug API had been done. This has resulted in availability of generics, which are prized way lower than the patented drug. One can argue the patent acquisition was a result of lot of R&D and needs to be adequately compensated, but then again I think healthcare in the country benefits if people get affordable medicines albeit at expense of big pharma.

The Indians have had the benefit of watching the abuse of the US patent system stifle innovation, which is ironic since that is the  raison d'être of the whole IP regime in the first place.

With luck, perhaps they may lead the way towards showing how it should be done and reforming IP as a whole.

The concept that you can own an intangible idea, and limit the ability of others to build upon that, is a uniquely American concept that was pushed into law and forced down other countries' throats because in America, corporations write the laws using lobbyists. We really need to reform these laws because they are now stifling innovation and competition against Indian and Chinese companies.

Or how about this?  
We start teaching kids about the Internet and technology in like 1st grade so that they'll be prepared and know what stuff to avoid.  
It's scary how many people don't know a thing about technology but still use it all the time.  
  
Edit: I should elaborate on what I mean by "stuff to avoid".  
Stuff to avoid is a pretty wide category in which I'd include porn (although that always seems to finds a way), malware, viruses, gore, shady people, giving away personal information, uploading pictures of yourself, and one more thing.  
That one more thing is **disinformation**!  
We didn't learn about source criticism in school until like 7th grade and that is way too late in today's society.  
Kids are very easily manipulated and gullible. Give them access to a bunch of racist and misleading blogs and they'll believe almost anything they read on it. We need to start teaching kids at a pretty early age that people lie and that you shouldn't trust what you read on the Internet.  
  
I believe that the failure to teach children about source criticism at an early age is one of the leading causes of the rise of right wing populist parties here in Europe in the past decade.

How about schools actually modernize something for the first time in a century? Honestly, if the new generation of kids isn't responding to your teaching strategy, don't just try to squeez them back over the margin. If a doctor from 1890 showed up to work in a modern hospital, they would have no idea what was going on, because technology is utilized as it evolves. A school teacher from back then on the other hand would be right in their element if they walked into a classroom today. Why don't we stop trying to make kids learn in an environment that continues to grow less and less effective

I remember that our classrooms banned fiction books not part of the syllabus, after too many kids were found reading novels instead of paying attention in class. The reason was simple - the teachers were completely fucking dull and the lessons were too easy.

We allowed our son to purchase his own phone with money saved up from Christmas and birthdays and lawnmowing when he was 14. Three years later, he still has the same phone. He's never broken it-- not the screen or anything else. While I wish we'd waited until he was a bit older, requiring he purchase it with his own money did seem to give him respect for the thing. My other son didn't own one until he got a job and bought it with his own money at age 18.

4179 :: MIT Team Uses Modified Kinect to Boost 3D Scan Resolution by 1000x - ...
Relevant excerpt for the title:

> The researchers’ experimental setup consisted of a Microsoft Kinect — which gauges depth using reflection time — with an **ordinary polarizing photographic lens placed in front of its camera.** In each experiment, the researchers took three photos of an object, rotating the polarizing filter each time, and their algorithms compared the light intensities of the resulting images.
> 
> On its own, **at a distance of several meters**, the Kinect can resolve physical features as small as a **centimeter or so across**. But with the addition of the polarization information, the researchers’ system could resolve features in the range of **tens of micrometers**, or one-thousandth the size.

I'm fascinated by the potential of such a technology where point-to-point communication can happen with line of sight with vastly-reduced interference from other signals. You can't have tons of wifi routers in a dense space because the channels quickly become saturated, but this would conceivably allow you to focus your communication beam as much as or as little as you want.

This is great, if you are doing things like editing high definition video that you're hosting on a server in your basement.  Except, you know, 224 GB/s doesn't do much good when you're limited to at best 1GB/s out of your ethernet card.  Or 60Mbps to the internet.

It's very interesting but not currently anything that anyone at home (or honestly in most businesses) could use even if it was on the shelves right now.  Still, gotta do research. Something will come of it eventually.

I don't disagree with Mark Zuckerberg trying to appear more principled than his actions suggest, but every FB service is blocked on China. Maybe all of the meetings with Chinese leaders was him trying to get them to stop blocking western services (obviously not for "freedom", but the largest internet market in the world being opened up to US companies)? I don't see "kissing up to China" in this.

What??? Zuckerberg hates peoples personal privacy and thinks everyone's name should be plastered over all of their online interactions. That's why "Sign in with Facebook" became a thing. I mean, Christopher Poole is Marks antithesis for christs sake.

Only one thing is important to Facebook as a company; User Data. Everything else can be compromised on as long as they get what they're after, and pleading for internet freedom is only a brand appeal maneuver to garner public leniency.

186
4172 :: Europe has the exact same legislation killing open router software as...
Let's take it step by step here for why you're wrong.

1. EU is not Europe. Your link is about the EU, not Europe.
2. EU does not have laws. Your link is to a directive. A directive is not law, and instead is just an order to put something into effect, which can be through law or any other way, depending on what the directive is.
3. Directives does not enter effect instantly. In this case, it only requires the member states to enter that into law before 2018. Until then, it's all entirely voluntary for member states with any such law.
4. The sentence in question does actually not prevent open router software like the one FCC is suggesting. It only requires that the equipment can verify that the software is compliant with the laws regarding radio equipment, such as, that the equipment can verify that the software being loaded does not increase the transmit power higher than 1W and so on. That can be done without killing the open router software.

Look, there's plenty enough wrong with these suggestions already that there's no reason to start making stuff up. It just detracts from the real problems and just makes us look like we're grasping at straws...
171
4172 :: Europe has the exact same legislation killing open router software as...
Wouldn't it be enough if the manufacturer locks down the wifi/radio chip so it can only function within the allowed parameters? Isn't this what is done mostly anyway? Router software wouldn't really be affected by this. You just can't use such a chip to send other kinds of data.

Wait, does this mean that all my routers which I did DIY with open source software is now illegal.

Or is it only illegal if the company who designed the router don't want to allow OS software on their router - if so, I should be alright, as I technically count as the person who designed the router.
11
4172 :: Europe has the exact same legislation killing open router software as...
Here is the text:

> Radio equipment within certain categories or classes shall be so constructed that it complies with the following essential requirements:

> (a) radio equipment interworks with accessories, in particular with common chargers;

No proprietary power connectors. This is probably in favor of consumers

> (b) radio equipment interworks via networks with other radio equipment;

Duh, this makes sense.

> (c) radio equipment can be connected to interfaces of the appropriate type throughout the Union;

Seems to be similar to (b)

> (d) radio equipment does not harm the network or its functioning nor misuse network resources, thereby causing an unacceptable degradation of service;

Pretty straight forward. Sad it has to be specified.

> (e) radio equipment incorporates safeguards to ensure that the personal data and privacy of the user and of the subscriber are protected;

Basically allow users to encrypt their WIFI and (I assume) have this feature enabled by default

> (f) radio equipment supports certain features ensuring protection from fraud;

That is specified rather generic

> (g) radio equipment supports certain features ensuring access to emergency services;

Does that mean, the device has to have a feature that allows emergency services to use my wifi?

> (h) radio equipment supports certain features in order to facilitate its use by users with a disability;

Makes sense

> (i) radio equipment supports certain features in order to ensure that software can only be loaded into the radio equipment where the compliance of the combination of the radio equipment and software has been demonstrated.

This is what bugs users.

Mass surveillance has failed to stop terrorism.  Our 4th Amendment rights are being violated in vain.

Keep in mind that this allows the government to blackmail even elected officials, essentially giving them control of those elected officials.  This is a threat to democracy.

This would mean to effectively do changes or repairs that happen outside of work hours, I'd have to drive the hour into the office.

Companies leaving the US for tax reasons is already major problem.  When a company like Apple has more cash oversees than in the US, why wouldn't Apple move abroad.  They would solve their tax issue, and their security issue.

I doubt Apple would move abroad, but if they lost, they would probably consider it.

Not surprising. When snowden released information about the illegal NSA wiretapping, a lot of the companies I worked with started moving all foreign operations offshore.

Domestic operations would be subject to wiretapping regardless, but many foreign companies now require that none of their data travel through the US except to service us customers.

Thankfully a number of cloud providers including Amazon have international data centers.

The 2nd issue here is: 11 years for a decision on the merits!!  

At what point does a judicial system become ineffective as a result of its inability to timely process matters?

Charles Dickens wrote a novel [Bleak House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleak_House) that concerned the probate of an estate that dragged on and on until nothing was left.  Dickens novel helped to spur an ongoing movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.  Commentators speculate that a source Dickens used was the real case of [Jennens vs Jennens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennens) " was abandoned in 1915 (117 years later)[citation] when the legal fees had exhausted the estate of funds."

**I'd like to see some sort of legal reform that expedites matters concerning government acts of spying, monitoring, and gag orders.**

54
4127 :: Samsung Warns Customers To Think Twice About What They Say Near Smart...
tl;dr; it's not a bug, it's a feature.  A feature for Samsung, not for you.

I worked for a startup that developed a disconnected, low cost, voice recognition system as a direct competitor of Nuance.  It was designed to work in $2-$10 microcontrollers with less than 100K of RAM, 40MIPS, under 2 watts of power, and it worked pretty damned well if I d say so myself.  No need for internet, there was no long term storage, it had a half second audio buffer and three second phrase buffer and then it was gone as soon as you stopped speaking.  We foresaw this happening, privacy fears, and made it a selling point that absolutely nothing about our system would violate your privacy (if the company that bought the system had their own long term storage or internet transmission that was their problem).  The trade-off being that it could only work on a few dozen key phrases, and if chosen poorly could get confused ("power on" vs "power off" had a 30% false detection rate, but "power up" vs "power down" only had a 2% false detection rate) but most smart TVs that need the internet for processing do this anyway, having a small selection of commands.

We couldn't get a buyer.  Like, we had a lot of interest, many companies used our dev system to create prototypes and made feature requests, and we even one major company (who would sue me for mentioning names) use it in a 100'000 unit prototype run but it took forever to actually get them to sign a contract, and we failed to get any investors time and time again.  Ultimately we ran out of time and out of money and the company folded, the IP lost to the void.

The whole experience, dealing with these companies and finding out what they want, I've actually grown convinced that they literally do not care about your privacy at all: or rather they care in the exact opposite way that you do; they wanted records, they wanted stats, they wanted traceability, they wanted to be able to distinguish different speakers even when they weren't speaking key phrases (a feature we were well on our way to adding when funding ran out).  It's all just more data for them to pick through and figure out who is watching what and how to market things to you.

In Nuance's defense, it does take a lot of data to make a good voice recognition system, hundreds of hours of recorded voice data, and more data means improved performance, so saying they're collecting speech data to improve recognition wouldn't be too far off the mark.  My company used employees and family to generate our initial data, and regular re-recordings of different phrases to improve it (I logged dozens of hours myself just saying the same phrase slightly differently into a microphone) but once it was out to the customer that was the end, we didn't need any further recordings.  If a big company like Nuance needs voice data they should be able to collect it from their large employee base, or even pay people to do it on contract; you need hundreds of hours of audio, not millions, there is literally no need to be recording everything that everyone says always.

Sorry for the long rant, I just really loved that company and the work we were doing and even though it's been several months since we closed shop I kinda still don't want to believe it's gone.

Well, to be fair, it isn't *just* the surveillance.  It's also the lists that are generated from that surveillance.  Like the ["Terrorist Screening Database"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Screening_Database) that has designated somewhere between 1 in 300 to 1 in 650 Americans as potential "terrorists," depending on how you count.

Which, of course, is insane.  Could you even find that many looking to commit acts of terror in USA in [Raqqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Raqqah)?  Of course, once you are on the list, there is no way off.  And no way to know how you got there in the first place.

Bye bye to notice and opportunity.  No notice of your accusation, and no opportunity to address the accusation in court.

Hell, maybe this comment gets deemed "subversive" and I end up on a list.

Welcome to America 2016.  You are more likely to be killed by a coconut than a terrorist, but a substantial number of my fellows have decided they are more afraid of terrorists than they are of a police state, so here we are.

I can't understand how such a large group of Americans could be convinced that destroying our own ideals is good for the country. How do you get multiple agencies of people who once wanted to be patriots to strive to be more like the Soviet Union was?  

How does someone convince themselves to move from defending our national security to becoming the secret police?

And every time they fail at their real job, which seems to be always, they get to increase their power because we're not a country of intelligent freethinkers.

They should kill themselves out of shame rather than undermine this great nation.  I personally hope their monitors cause eye cancer.

But most of all I hope they fail, not just because I want my children to grow up in a free country, but I also want the history books to paint them as the traitorous scum they are.

It happens in other countries all the time and just because it's not happening widely that we know of doesn't mean it won't in the future.

I think by 'Hitler problem' he meant a social segregation between genetically-engineered people and plain old humans, which would likely lead to racism and conflict.

What a terrible article.  They only quoted half the interview, quoting him totally out of context in order to give a totally misleading impression.

The actual interview was on this blog:

http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html

>— I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming. He doesn’t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: “The whole system is collapsing. You don’t see someone who’s 90 years old and it’s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The whole system is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.” Now with anyone else—literally anyone else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk fixes shit for humanity. So what did I do?

>Me: Well…but isn’t this important enough to try? Is this something you’d ever turn your attention to?

>Elon: The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.

>Me: You’re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.

>Elon: You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it’s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don’t know.

>Me: I think there’s a way. You’ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that’s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it’s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.

>Elon: I mean I do think there’s…in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That’s the only way to do it.

>Me: And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.

>Elon: [Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze] It’s software.

Eugenics was an idea of British social-darwinist capitalists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism

It was then copied in the US that became the most aggressive activists for racial purity. The US was the first country to create an administration for tracking unfit people and preventing them to reproduce. They also volontarily killed "by neglience" tousands a year in mental hospitals.

Germany only improved the US methods and applied then at a much larger scale. Mein Kampf just copied the writtings of US eugenists, with less focus on blacks (they were not numerous in mainland Germany).

ITT - People assuming Apple's target audience are gamers. Compare their computers to gaming rigs which don't fall under Apple's target market.

VR right now is the wet dream of gamers. Once VR has widespread applications outside of gaming, Apple will revisit the topic. Apple doesn't build machines for gaming. The people buying VR headsets are probably people who build their own high end rigs and are not likely to use VR sets with Macs.

4049 :: Kim Dotcom: Assange Will Be Clinton's Worst Nightmare. 'He has access...
Hillary Clinton is pro-censorship and repeatedly has stated she wants video games treated like pornography. (Her husband is also on record saying school shootings only happen because of video games). You would need to be 18 and be carded to purchase them. Allowing a kid to play a video game with any mature content if they're not 18 should be the same as giving porn to your kids and punishable by law.

Both she and her husband have REPEATEDLY been caught taking foreign money illegally in campaigns, hiding it, lying about it and feigning ignorance each time. It is important to trust that your President isn't being bought off by foreign donations.

They're independently wealthy and have protected the rights of the rich and big corporations. Bill Clinton was the one that removed regulations on banks that led to the mortgage crisis.

Despite massive wealth, neither will make a speaking appearance without charging ridiculous fees.

Ignoring for a moment the number of scandals Bill Clinton was linked to as governor and President (including pardoning mafia families that gave him money and potentially covering up murders as governor), Hillary Clinton has repeatedly been linked to scandals where she loses all records and covers up all evidence.

Voting for Hillary means you support domestic spying, censorship, corruption, big business, banks and a total lack of transparency.

Arguably the best part of the Bill Clinton administration was him acting somewhat like a Republican, compromising with Newt Gingrinch and slashing big government spending to balance the budget. Hillary Clinton never behaved like that as a senator.

If you're a Democrat, I implore you to vote for any other Democrat in the primaries. She really isn't the candidate you're looking for.

It also seems to me like BitTorrent activity has been dying. There is a lot of activity on new and popular things but beyond that there is now a large drop off. Nobody seeds previous seasons of shows anymore. Even for some shows episodes need to be grabbed soon after it airs because the number of seeders can drop quickly. Forget about the obscure things. The days where I could find some random thing that few people care about are gone.

> Comcast's response is that Stream TV doesn't go over the internet, but is delivered over the same closed path as its cable streams, and so is exempt from the rules. It calls Stream TV a cable service, not an OTT service.

So, you are telling me that cable TV is just data on a private LAN? 

Hmmm data....   

This is the same type of scenario as with most telecommunication these days that are not on an actual analog phone line.  All texts, and most phone calls are typically data, just like the current digital video streams.  

I think an age for unified datum needs to be called to order.

1724
4009 :: Youtube has taken a popular YouTuber's site address, given it to a co...
**I just went through this yesterday. Here's why it happened**:

* Youtube.com/lush & youtube.com/user/Lush originally belonged to this dude.
* In 2014, youtube allowed users to rename their channels (sweet!).
* End 2014, youtube introduced a new youtube.com/c/Lush user url format (not many knew about this).
* The new URL format also OVERWRITES where the  youtube.com/Username points to, (but not youtube.com/User/Username - which remains the same).
* Youtube accounts are now linked to Google+ pages!!!
* The Youtube.com/c/Username is given "by an algorithm" to whomever has the google.com/+Lush page (the cosmetics company, with 40,000 G+ fans in this case).
* FYI: Lush the youtuber has 900,000 youtube subscribers.
* All Lush cosmetics had to do was click one of the many prompts to claim their new youtube url, and they received youtube.com/c/Lush -- which is fine (and not their fault at all).
* **The crazy part is that Youtube then overwrites where the old youtube.com/Username points to!!! It does this in all cases.**

Not that this is fair in any way, but if the guy had got his G+ page a custom URL, and linked his youtube & google+ pages, this *might* have been avoided.

I'd like to know more about how usable youtube.com/username was in the past, and whether youtube ever suggested linking directly to it.

Seems pretty cut and dried: normally you wouldn't notice misfire information from your leg, except that you're subconsciously expecting the feeling as it signals your phone is vibrating.

This is why blind positivity bothers me do much. I find that people who think this way don't/won't acknowledge problems or negative feedback, and redirect criticism as someone "being negative". I'm very introverted, and I know I initially come off as aloof or stuck up. Once I get to know someone over time, I'm more social. I can't imagine how poorly I would come off on this ridiculous concept. To be judged solely on one off interactions is an absolute nightmare of an idea for so many people.

We are bold innovators and sending big waves into motion and we will not apologize for that because we love you enough to give you this gift. We know you are amazing, special, and unique individuals and most likely would never shout that from the rooftops. The people who know you will though…they choose to be around you and in your life and support you even when you don’t like yourself. We have come so far as a society but in a digital world we are becoming so disconnected and lonely. You deserve better and to have more abundance, joy, and real authentic connections. You deserve to make better decisions with more information to protect your children and your biggest assets. You have worked so hard to get the reputation you have among the people that know you. As innovators we want to make your life better and have the opportunity to prove how great it feels to be loved by so many in a public space. We are a positivity app launching in November 2015. Whether you love us or our concept or not; we still welcome everyone to explore this online village of love and abundance for all."

3976 :: Your Toner Is No Good Here: Region-Coding Ink Cartridges... For The C...
> Region coding for DVDs and videogames makes a certain amount of sense, provided you're willing to make a small logic buy-in on windowed releases. But ink? It's not like Australians need to wait six weeks for HP to cut loose ink cartridges so as not to sabotage the US release. The only reason to do this is to tie paying customers into the most expensive ink and toner. This lock-in is cemented by many printers' refusal to recognize third-party replacement cartridges and/or allow refills of existing manufacturer cartridges. 

Excellent summary straight from the article

And this is why Brother and their laser printers are (probably) the #1 seller on Amazon now.

IMO Epson is changing the game with the tank system.  I can't see how it could they could regulate what ink you put into the reservoirs; you squeeze ink from a bottle into it.  This could open a huge market of cheap bulk ink that could save the customer hundreds over the life of the printer.  The only roadblock I see is the price; will the average consumer really take all factors in the true price of the printer and see that the cheaper upfront cost is actually more expensive in the long run?

I had this exact same situation fuck over a customer of ours (I work for an MSP)

They had a Xerox Colorqube printer (it uses dry crayon-like cubes of ink or some shit) and they couldnt get the printer to print due to an error message on the printer. they had 3 brand new packs of cubes (bought in the US) and no matter what you did, it wouldnt accept them.

did some digging in the printer and got the error log, found a service manual online that told you what the errors meant and it said incorrect region... looked at the region the printer was set for, and it was set in the UK. either he bought it from europe, or the first set of qubes were european and it locked them to it. xerox wanted 300+ dollars for the "flash" to un-lock the printer.

guy ended up buying a brand new colorqube printer because of the cost-vs-benefit of fixing this one i think (he's a multimillionaire). 
bottom line, he got fucked for no reason

I'm honestly surprised nobody has tried to corner the market on refillable ink printers yet.

3976 :: Your Toner Is No Good Here: Region-Coding Ink Cartridges... For The C...
I work as a purchaser for an importer of ink and toner cartridges. Selling both OEM (Printer manufacturers brands) and 3rd part remanufactured products. 

Printing is extremely wasteful and millions of cartridges a year go into landfill because of the electronic barriers put in place by the manufacturers purely for profit. Although the waste is a side issue its an issue worth mentioning.

The problem of DRM in printer consumables mainly affects home or small office users trying to save money by using 3rd party products to run their printers. Large companies or heavy users tend to use MPS (Managed print services) where you usually pay per page. When on a service contract like this your consumables and printers are replaced as and when needed. But for lower usage consumers having to buy ink cartridges is usually an expensive shopping trip!

Because of the extortionate prices they charge for their brand of ink, consumers seek a cheaper option other than the OEM cartridges. This is also the start of the vicious cycle for printer manufacturers.

They sell you the printer at a loss on the good faith that you will go back and purchase their brand of ink. Which they make HUGE amounts of profit on. So much profit in fact that in some cases refilling your printer can cost more than the cost of the printer in the first place. Because they charge so much you don't buy their inks and they lose that big chunk of profit from you.

Instead of choosing to re-think their pricing strategy and reducing the price of their consumables, they spend millions of the profit they make on their cartridges to develop ways of controlling the consumables your printer will use instead of just charging a fair price. Admittedly the example of the xerox printers being blocked is on the extreme end of the consumable control scale. But many users experience time consuming and often very frustrating issues when trying to save some money.

If you have ever used a 3rd party cartridge you will have almost 100% had some sort of issue at one point in time. Whether it is cartridge recognition issues or incredibly annoying warning messages that after each page printed pause all print jobs to remind you you are using a 3rd party cartridge. All these problems are simply there to try and force you to use their inks.

The software provided with the printer is also part of the DRM issue. When you install the printer suite to make use of the all the features of your new machine you are often asked questions such as "would you like *insert manufacturer here* to keep your printer software up to date to ensure the best printing experience" which most people would agree to. What most people don't know is that in the small print that they can update the firmware of your printer automatically meaning a 3rd party cartridge that worked yesterday, might not work tomorrow.

Add into that threats of invalidated printer warranties for consumers and law suits for 3rd party remanufacturers and distributors and its all gets quite complicated.

Properly remanufactured cartridges are a fantastic solution for consumers to not only the money problem but the waste problem too. A normal cartridge can usually be used at least twice without any loss in performance. But it means you don't go and buy another cartridge to recoup the manufacturers losses from when you bought the printer!

Another problem is that In the search for ever cheaper alternatives many Chinese companies are selling very poor quality copies of cartridges which are produced on mass to be sold incredibly cheaply. Quality so bad that it can cause permanent damage to printers. Giving weight to the software issues put into place by the printer manufacturers.

The good news for consumers is that there seems to be a change in the market. MPS is becoming more accessible for smaller users and printers like Epson's new Eco-Tank range, where you get a years worth of ink (based from epsons average numbers) in reservoirs attached to the printer, which can then be refilled simply using bottles of ink. This means that the manufacturers can still make enough profit from either their service contract or the initial sale of the printer instead of relying on forcing consumers into buying their products. Whilst at the same time reducing the immense waste associated with printing.

For 3rd party cartridge companies it means a slow shift in the market that they will have to adjust to. Offering MPS solutions themselves and replacement bulk ink or other consumables for the next generation of printers as the old ways possibly fade.

This has turned into a much bigger and rambling post than i intended but its rare i get to talk about what i buy without thinking im boring people.

**TL:DR Printer manufacturers are ripping people off by making cheaper options sometimes barely functional but may be changing their ways**

It's great to see that a city is willing to get tough with them, it's unfortunate Verizon's very obvious response was to drag its feet. Here are a few of they very terrible highlights...

Verizon last year blamed landlords for delays.  ...

The Communications Workers of America union has blamed Verizon's fiber shortcomings on job cuts.

Last night I asked some utility guys what they were working on in Portland, OR. They said they were installing fiber optic for Verizon, but not for FIOS, but to the cell towers themselves.

I just looked it up an it is called Fiber-to-the-Antenna, or FTTA, if you are interested.

there's a "dark fiber" article out there detailing how the telcos got away with stealing billions of dollars from their subscribers by charging them for fiber op lines, but never delivering them.

it was part of the de-regulation deals made back in the '80s & '90s.

My building has had the micro conduit and mdu boxes installed well over a year ago. No progress has been made. I call every 4 months and no ever has an answer for me. It is crazy our building did major hallway renovations to accommodate the conduits and yet the company line is "unfortunately many landlords are blocking our access". I'm like "they let you guys tear our building apart there is no way this is the fault of my building"

Two questions/problems:

2) A large amount of the oceans plastic exists as a partially-dissolved mass floating a few/dozen feet under the surface, would this clean that also?

Excellent! It seems like the only real hurdle in fulfilling this kind of bold ambition is how to properly reprocess the plastics to make them a viable building material.

I wonder if they could be remelted and stretched to become fiber reinforcement for some kind of ecosphere construction projects in Africa or other warm areas.

Interesting. I wonder what the cost is for something like this is? The article says they plan a 60 mile wide one by 2020 if successful, but that seems awfully ambitious unless this 1) Is extremely cheap or 2)Incredibly easy to setup once made.

3933 :: FBI Is Pushing Back Against Judge's Order to Reveal Tor Browser Exploit
I think the "faulty lock" analogy doesn't fully reflect the nature of the situation. Sure, the way they bypass a physical lock does not have bearing on what they did once they are inside. But in the case of TOR, we need to ask how they determined which lock to pick, as the steps required to do that may have violated the defendant's rights, or the rights of other innocent people.
344
3933 :: FBI Is Pushing Back Against Judge's Order to Reveal Tor Browser Exploit

351
3923 :: TPP Leaks Shows US Stands Firm That Companies Should Be Free To Abuse...
Uhh, it looks like the U.S. and Japan oppose adding the underlined text (italicized below because I don't know how to underline here)

>A Party may also provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or nullified on the basis that the patent is used in a manner determined to be anti­competitive {, or abusive,} in a judicial or administrative proceeding, *{and} where the grant of a compulsory license would not have been sufficient to prevent the said anti­competitive use or abuse*

In other words, the situations where the U.S. and Japan would have a patent cancelled, revoked or nullified are broader than the situations other countries would, because other countries would subject the test to an additional requirement.  This renders the treaty closer to the doctrine of patent misuse as it exists in U.S. law.
13

I think that the USPTO needs serious reform.  However saying that a government can "cancel, revoke or nullfy" a patent if "the patent is used in a manner determined to be anti-competitive," doesnt make sense.  All patents, by default, are anti-competitive.  That is the point of a patent.

I'm completely against this trade deal all together... but if my legalese is reading it correct, it kind of sounds like the US and Japan are trying to add terminology to put the brakes on patent trolls? 

Of course... the way they are going about it, it would be in a pro-corporate manner rather than protecting the 'mom and pop' type patent holder.

While acknowledging the late insight into how the DCMA solved nothing, it's surprising to see the RIAA still wanting to draw a picture of "but, back then, it worked":

> Unfortunately, while the system worked when isolated incidents of infringement occurred on largely static web pages—as was the case when the law was passed in 1998—it is largely useless in the current world where illegal links that are taken down reappear instantaneously. The result is a never-ending game that is both costly and increasingly pointless."

It didn't and the opposition not only showed how it can (and later would) be used to take down content without a valid copyright claim, but also pointed out that the piracy trend doesn't receive its fuel from a lack of copyright enforcement.

What did eventually help was an industry realising that the sheer available of pirated music acted as a main factor while having no legal counterpart at the time. *Now* we are looking at streaming services being affordable, [grabbing some of the former pirates](https://torrentfreak.com/music-piracy-continues-to-decline-thanks-to-spotify-110928/) and new customers.

3906 :: The US government is already lying like crazy about surveillance afte...
I heard something to this effect on NPR as early as Saturday morning. They were talking to someone who might have been a French investigator or a US one I don't remember, but he said "I guarantee you that when we really start to look into this we're going to find out that the terrorists coordinated their efforts using smartphone apps that send self destructing encrypted messages." He then blamed those apps for preventing them from stopping the attack. Despite this however, suddenly after the attack we've identified all the people who were involved, who their connections are, where they came from, and where the attack was planned, and who coordinated it all less than 24 hours later. So what, did they all just stop using encryption right after the attack? "Ah well, we're done here  let's let them catch us all now." Seems like traditional investigative work is operating unimpeded.
17
3906 :: The US government is already lying like crazy about surveillance afte...
Imagine you were spying on billions of people, and they each produced 10 pieces of data (phone call, text email, etc.) a day. 

This data is sucked up and stored by the NSA. You can search by peoples names, affiliations or other known data. 

But if you don't know any of this base information. You have 20-30 billion pieces of information to sort through... every day.

Even with the countless monies we throw at the NSA it's basically too much data and no matter how many brilliant people with complicated algorithms running on countless processors, you just can't create logic where none exists.

As such, the NSA is basically useless for predicting terrorism with any real certainty. Even if you identified individuals and monitored them 24/7, they would likely not share their confidential plans via unencrypted channels or in any sort of plain text readable format. Decrypting these communications still takes time so whatever data you do have is useless in the short term.

TL;DR - NSA does not have the capability to predict the future due to too much data to sift through or encryption preventing sifting.

Lots of funny business by the DoJ and the FBI. 

For starters, by all accounts this was his work phone and it [belonged to San Bernardino County](http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/20/technology/apple-fbi-san-bernardino-shooting/index.html), so the chances are minuscule that it contains any terroristy stuff on it. The two terrorists destroyed all of their other personal phones but left this one untouched. Probably because it contained nothing important.  

Second, the FBI coerced the county into [changing the password on Farook's iCloud account](http://www.ibtimes.com/fbi-confirms-changing-syed-farooks-icloud-password-attempt-access-recent-messages-2317135) that contained all of his backups, so the FBI now only has the iPhone as a source.  

It seems highly plausible that the FBI intentionally had the county change the iCloud account so they could use this as a ploy to go after encryption and have an excuse to put backdoors in everything. The FBI has shown in the past that they're not to be trusted to protect our privacy with the whole [Stingray tracking controversy.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/08/fbi_wireless_intercept_and_tracking_team_files_reveal_new_information_on.html) Hopefully Apple can expose this really devious FBI plan for what it is: a power grab to go after every American's privacy.

Since the start of the War on Terror the government has been slowly (and not so slowly) eroding our freedom and privacy in the name of security. It's never going to end until they try to take too much, something that people care more about ~~then~~ than they are afraid, or try to take it from someone powerful enough to push back. Hopefully this is the issue that starts pushing the trend in the other direction, towards freedom and away from security.

US government is prohibited from interfering with encryption by 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendment, and perhaps more.  It's clearly a matter of free speech, and privacy, and if it is a weapon, it's purely a defensive one which people have an inalienable right to as well.

This is clearly government showing that they're only interested in dominion, and justice, rights, due process, etc., is all a pretense to keep the slaves thinking they're free.

Major strategic error??  This implies that they wanted to weasel things that violate our rights behind closed doors without letting us know about it until it was too late.

The big "strategic error" is putting these people in a position of power in the first place; and the second biggest is not removing them from power sooner.

I also think them using your internet by default to seed their updates to other people is ridiculous too.
I mean if you sat on a connection with a max of 40kb/s upload it uses a majority of your upload speed.  Most users won't even notice this exists and will just 'deal' with slow internet.

>Reading rants about Windows 10 privacy on Facebook is particularly ironic.

Ha. Good point.

Worth pointing out that these were **private trackers**. 

You know, the ones that track and collect enormous amount of user data in a first place. Most of them require you to meet certain performance standard of seeding to remain a member, which...yeah you guessed right, requires recording and storing information about everything users are downloading and uploading. They store a comprehensive record of all your illegal activities, ready to be plucked by a dishonest staff member or a hacker. Unlike a publicly operating company, the staff is not accountable to anybody, and I doubt their security is on the level of Google, either.

Unintended irony of the year, that.

Eh, just mindless paranoia. Not saying that Windows 10 isn't anti-privacy, but to think that their privacy settings  is somehow possibly a danger to your tracker is pretty ridiculous. Also, most people who use private trackers are probably savvy enough to change their User Agent string when necessary, so it is not even an effective ban.

3877 :: Apple's stock loses over $160B as analysts forecast smartphone decline
Smartphones are NOT in decline, those sales are actually going up.

It's the premium smartphones from Apple and Samsung that are in decline. (when I find the chart I will update this with a link)

[Like the cheap Windows PC, cheap Android phones that are "just good enough" and can be replaced inexpensively if they break that are taking over.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/walmarts-10-smartphone-has-better-specs-than-the-original-iphone) Note: This is an extreme example of the low end, there are other phones that cost under $100 (not $600 like a iPhone or Galaxy) and are rather good quality.

[Apple only wants to sell premium phones locked with their special operating system, not the 85% market share Android.](http://www.tech-thoughts.net/2013/05/global-smartphone-market-share-trends-android-iphone-windows-phone.html)

[Apple makes over 68% of it's revenue from the iPhone, the Mac only represents 6%, so the rest are not enough to keep the company in the current money flow it's enjoying now.](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53289ae5ecad047b21ed92ff-1200-900/2014_03_12_profit.jpg)

So like in the PC wars...cheap and disposable wins again. Expect the iPhone market share to whittle down to a mere 5-7% like the Mac market share is. 

Apple has had these fad peaks and valleys before; the Mac, the iPod, the iPad and iWatch (both short lived) and now the iPhone. It's because they cater to the consumer market which always wants a new toy and the cheaper, just as good or even better alternatives arrive to steal Apple's market share away.

**Apple won't die, not with all those billions**, they just need to come up with the next greatest thing or morph into something else as a company like IBM who left the PC market. Why we hear rumors of a iCar.

It might be all those "gold" colored Apple gear are designed to be collectors items.

It might be they have something NEW for the new year and this is a stock buying opportunity.

We haven't even reached 2 billion people in the world who have smartphones yet. (note:.. I said "smartphones"... not "cellphones")

World population is slightly over 7 billion. 

The smartphone market may slow down a little (as most affluent people have been able to afford them for years).. but we're in a epoch now where humans are enriching themselves faster than any other time in history,.. and the amount of people (even in 3rd world countries) who can afford a basic smartphone/cellphone is going up all the time.) 

That may not be Apple's desired demographic,.. but we'd be stupid to assume Apple hasn't internally discussed this dynamic. If they DO release another 4inch phone... I'd bet money they do it (primarily) to have something to offer the "developing world".. and not because of rich people who want a smaller phone.

I run a non-profit digital policy research organization and have filed a number of requests with the FBI and various branches of the DOJ with similar results.

Our current focus is on cybercrimes and the CFAA and in response to our inquiries we've made very little progress in the past few months. So far they've claimed multiple *national security* exemptions, delayed in every way imaginable, and in the case of one sent to the EOUSA the initial request was filed 8 months ago, they're response was received 6 months ago, and they've failed to respond to any inquiry into that request since.

The fucked up part is that they can get away with it unless you can afford to sue them in federal court to force them to comply with the law.

The information were requesting is related closed cases. It's recently come to our attention that in several of these however, the terms of plea agreements accepted by some of the defendants prohibit anyone from ever requesting information in that case under the FOIA. How the fuck this is even legal is beyond me.

As one of the last remaining Windows Media Center users/enthusiasts, I welcome anything that brings awareness to the public that any alternative to cable company provided equipment even exists.  I save at least $30/mo thanks to WMC.  Over the years, this has added up to thousands of dollars.

I'd 10x rather have the ability to purchase *channels* a la carte than purchase cable boxes a la carte.

A cable box costs ~$11/month to rent from my provider. Having to shell out $100 for a cable box and avoid that $11/month fee is underwhelming.

Peeling away the channels I don't watch in my subscription would easily save me $50-60/month.

I know how to make money guys.  
  
1) Make a very successful restaurant chain.  
2) Shut down almost every other restaurant, leaving most people with either your restaurant or bust.  
3) Introduce food caps, if your family eats above a certain amount of food, the price goes up by an extreme amount.  
4) Profit, now people either have to submit to your will or always cook food.  
  
BTW, the food caps are there because some some families eat too much and this slows down the cooks for the other customers. Even though this is a regular occurrence, we will not hire more cooks, but instead charge people more because we only see our customers as cows made out of money.

I wish we could organize a massive DDOS against the ISPs to get them to admit the network needs upgrading. Every single user needs to set every single device their own to torrent and seed as much data as possible regardless of data plan. This will hit the network hard and cripple their ability to function costing them billions, and when everyone gets their bill for the insane charges they try to levy, everyone should refuse to pay until the infrastructure is upgraded, costing them further billions. 

They would have no choice but to comply or face bankruptcy.

3832 :: The FCC Has To Remind ISPs Not To Spend Taxpayer Subsidies On Booze, ...
Hold on, hold on, HOLD ON. ISPs are enormous, lack competition, and set prices, and they're being SUBSIDIZED by the government? Has anyone looked at whether or not this contributed to them, you know, becoming dominant territorial monopolies? Aren't they also subsidized and protected by local governments?

How the hell did passing net neutrality, another set of stupid rules for them to game, get so much press as a catch-all solution when THIS SHIT IS GOING ON? We've only been addressing the symptoms, not the root cause of the disease!

The second a company goes from Private to Public is the second their priorities shift from customers and employees to shareholders.

Public companies are about making their stock price increase 3 months at a time, not about making sure that people have jobs and benefits or offering quality products.

Cooperatives, Employee stock ownership, Worker owned businesses, B-corporations, and other more democratic work-place environments are gaining in popularity as people recognize the destructive and mindless greed that is modern corporate capitalism.

Benefit corporations, or B-Corps, are one of the fast growing alternatives to the normal structure of corporations, which by law must pursue profit.  Instead, a B-corporation's by-laws allow what would be profits to be used for community, environmental or employee benefits. 

For anyone interested, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=60&v=V-VFZUFJwt4) that explains more about B-corporations.  Also, here is BLabs [B-corporation](http://www.bcorporation.net/) website that lists some B-corporations.

3817 :: Good guy Kickstarter says no to IPO, restructures as public benefit c...
Let's be clear: a public benefit corporation is not the same thing as a nonprofit. The only difference between a regular ol' corporation and a public benefit corporation is that a public benefit corporation can say they have goals other than delivering as much value to shareholders as possible, thus reducing legal liability for the executives... that's pretty much it. Like jeez, I can't imagine why Kickstarter would want to protect themselves against patent trolls, copyright hawks, etc. or basically anyone who would want to sue a creator behind a campaign and could find a reason to name Kickstarter as a defendant in the case. 

Their pledge to not use any "tax loopholes" is pretty absurd. Unless they specifically say which loopholes they will not abuse, you can treat this as a corporate platitude.

This is fantastic. Not just because we can ensure that Kickstarters stay true to purpose... but because it's a high profile company, standing as a beacon and showing other companies that there are other options for them.

The more high profile companies switching over to B-corporations , the more likely it is for others to follow suit when the time comes to make that decision.

Because money and profit only provides so much meaning and fulfillment - making a positive and meaningful impact while still gunning for some profits - allows you to feed the soul... and the body.

I've often wondered if anyone has broken the update mechanisms of various applications.  Half a dozen applications on my Win7 machine have installed services to do their own updating.  If someone could break one of those, it would be perfect for installing malware or spying on me.

This is a loaded headline to bait you into viewing and upvoting it.

>But new documents show that the agencies [reversed engineer software so that they could find weaknesses in software and exploit them] to some of the most popular antivirus software, potentially exposing hundreds of millions of people to dangerous viruses, according to a report from The Intercept.

It basically says that documents show that NSA and GCHQ reverse engineered software to see what was vulnerable. It's assumed they used this against their own population, because we all assume that because fuck spy agencies. It may be that they reversed them to see what they're capable of defending against, and to build their own signatures.

Hacking things is a dangerous game, and leaks only show you a tiny portion of what's happening, but always what the person leaking information wants you to see. That governments hack is scary, but it doesn't necessarily mean they hack you or harm you -- but it always means they do it to each other.

Bear in mind the NSA exists to spy on foreign governments. That's the purpose of it. It's in the damn mission statement of the organization. The FBI exists to spy on you.

492
3794 :: Steam is experiencing major glitches and giving people access to each...
Is it giving actual access? From other threads on reddit it sounds more like a caching issue. Steam isn't giving access to the other accounts, but displaying the wrong (cached) account information.

It's probably a caching issue. Don't visit any steam pages while logged in just to be safe, but this is probably not a security breach, just someone fucking up and the servers caching stuff they really shouldn't be caching.

An explanation from the gaming subreddits: 
> 
> It's a problem with their caching-server (varnish), caching pages that should not be cached (such as Account-Details, Cart, etc.). It invalidates after some time and is re-cached when the next user visits the page with their profile. You are not actually logged in (as in, you take over the session of the user), you just see pages rendered for others than yourself. This is why different parts of steam appear as different users.
> 
> Which page you see is probably dependent on the edge node (first server you connect to) closest to you, hence why different users see different profiles.
> 
> My guess to how this could've happened is that an untested configuration got activated when steam went down earlier, e.g. due to an auto-conf service (puppet, chef) pulling an untested config or some of their live servers being replaced by staging / development servers. It's also possible that they were under heavy load and the engineer on duty reconfigured all their edge nodes to cache more aggressively.
> 
> Let's hope they fix this fast, because this is a major data leak. I can see private E-Mail and account names. Let's hope their cache server is not delivering internal pages.
> 
> Credit to: /u/mrallon

Of course we can't be sure that this is the case until Valve releases a public statement, but everything so far points in that direction.

About six months back, I was hired to fix a website in a similar situation: people were pressing save on admin forms, and it was saving to "random accounts" instead of the account they were editing. Nobody could figure it out. It worked 100% perfect in dev environment. They chopped it up to user error until more people complained. Then they brought me in.

It took me all of 10 minutes to realize the issue: the previous developer was saving the account ID as a static variable. Basically, everyone accessing the app was sharing one spot in memory to hold the account ID, so the last person that clicked "edit account" now has everyone saving to that ID. 

Whoops. They had to go and tell all their clients that they weren't crazy, and their app really was broken

5 million dollars won't change anything, they probably made more than that from forcing people to upgrade. Even if they didn't, 5 million dollars is about *0.1%* of their **monthly** *net profit*. Apple really won't give a damn (meaning they have no incentive *not* to do this kind of thing again).
527
3791 :: Lawsuit seeks more than $5M from Apple for slowing older iPhones with...
Essentially [this same lawsuit back in 2011 was thrown out by the judge](http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/10/judge_tosses_ibrick_lawsuit_over_ios_4_slowing_iphone_3g) after the plaintiff alleged that iOS 4 slowed down her iPhone 3G.

The point is, this happens every iPhone release -- the truth is that the releases are rushed to get features in and bugs fixed in time for the new phone to come out. Performance optimization doesn't get nearly enough time in the ".0" release, hence the reason that [iOS 9.2 improves performance for older devices and essentially fixes this problem](http://wccftech.com/ios-92-boosts-speed-fixes-ui-lag-iphone-models/).

As they say, don't attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.  This is clearly not intentional, or they wouldn't later fix it in the ".1" / ".2" releases.

Interesting that they used US Carnegie Mellon and somehow this gives the illusion that it becomes legal this way. How come if the FBI would do it would be illegal but when a university does it, it's different? The university should be held liable for breaking the law to prevent future actions like this to happen. It's disgusting at the same time that a university lends itself to do these kind of tasks, they aren't even police jobs anymore as the article itself claims, they are simply illegal attacks.

3776 :: FBI accused of paying US university for dark net attack
I'm not sure that CMU as a school should be vilified or entirely put to blame here. 

The research was almost certainly conducted by CERT, and the money paid either went directly to CERT or the [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/) (SEI), not CMU. CERT was born at CMU in the 80s, but they're now a [Federally Funded Research and Development Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_funded_research_and_development_centers) operating under the SEI. SEI's sponsors are DoD and the Army. CERT is in a weird position where the bulk of their contracts are for DHS and DoD, but they still do research at an academic level, and teach courses at CMU. From the [CERT website](http://www.cert.org/about/): 
"*The CERT Division is enriched by its connection to the internationally respected Carnegie Mellon University. Our proximity to other world-class researchers and practitioners enables numerous collaboration opportunities and strengthens our research focus. And because the CERT Division is located within the SEI, a federally funded research and development center at Carnegie Mellon University, the majority of our work contributes to government and national security efforts.*"

Over the years, it got to the point where there were so many government contracts that there was a split: now there's CERT (associated with the SEI at CMU) and US-CERT, a [full-on government organization](https://www.us-cert.gov/about-us). 

So in summary, do I think CMU gets the brunt of this anger? No. Do I think that things are way too murky between the work the SEI and CERT do, considering its affiliation with CMU? Perhaps. Should they split entirely from CMU to become a full-fledged government organization (similar to what US-CERT did) so that they can conduct this type of work? Yes. Will that ever happen? No. I don't think it will, because the operating budgets both CERT and SEI comprehensively have are way too big for CMU to just let go of, and because of the academic research that still occurs.

Edit: added one more link to SEI's site

3770 :: What Happens When You Talk About Salaries at Google
@EricaJoy's salary transparency experiment at Google

a thing bothered me yesterday and it's still bothering me today and so now i want to tell a story.

One Sunday, some former coworkers & I were bored, talking about salaries on the internal social network instance. A spreadsheet was created. we put our salaries in the sheet, realized that it was created on a public to the world spreadsheet, so I copied it to internal. I then put a form on it and posted the link to the form and the spreadsheet on my internal social network account.

It took off like wildfire.

It got reshared all over the place. People started adding pivot tables that did spreadsheet magic that highlighted not great things re: pay. I did some general housekeeping stuff to the sheet (normalizing the gender field where it could be, exchange rate stuff, that sort of thing).

More reshares.

More people adding pay.

It became a thing.

I was invited to talk to my manager on Mon or Tues. Higher up people weren't happy. She wasn't happy. Why did I do it? "Don't you know what could happen?" Nothing. It's illegal to retaliate against employees for sharing salaries. "Wellll....".

Meeting ended.

Sheet kept going.

People were thanking me for it. They were also sending me peer bonuses. here's how peer bonuses work @ former co:

If you did something good, someone peer bonuses you, you get $150 net in your next paycheck. An important thing I learned during that time: peer bonuses are rewarded at managers discretion. My manager was rejecting all of them. Wasn't sure if this would be good for the company. Wanted to see what the outcome was. Mind you once a PB is rejected, that can't be undone.

Meanwhile, one of the other people involved, a white dude (good friend I won't name, he can name himself if he wants), was also getting PBs. His weren't getting rejected. I told him mine were. He was pissed. Wanted to tell everyone what was happening. I declined. A smattering of people knew what was going on. Backchannels being what they are at former co. (lol IRC #yallknowwhoyouare), it got around. Rejecting PBs was so unheard of, ppl didn't know it was possible. There was outrage when they found out. Shock that I wasn't talking abt it. Meanwhile, spreadsheet still going, getting spread around, pointed questions being thrown at mgmt about sharing salary ranges (hahah no). Most people agreed that it was A Good Thing. PBs kept rolling in. Rejections kept rolling out. One PB eventually got approved. Way after everything died down. Because the person worded it in a way that was vary vague. Any that were outright about the spreadsheet got rejected. 7 total in the end I think?

Higher ups still pissed. Some I used to support as an exec tech would pointedly not interact w/ me anymore. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Before I left, about 5% of former co. had shared their salary on that sheet. People asked for & got equitable pay based on data in the sheet. The world didn't end. Everything didn't go up in flames because salaries got shared. But shit got better for some people.

I explicitly gave ownership of the sheet to someone else before I left so it couldn't be taken over by mgmt when I was gone (can happen).

I am thinking of this because of everyone celebrating the fact that Google put Ida B. Wells in the doodle yesterday. Ida B. Wells was great. She did stuff to affect change of such a magnitude that if I'm half the woman she was, I'm doing pretty good. I don't claim to come close, but from time to time, I do stuff that will make things better for people at the expense of the establishment. I'm a pretty big believer in justice and fairness and will fight for both if necessary. Fighting for justice & fairness INSIDE Google doesn't go over well. Salary sharing is only 1 example. Blogger porn. Real names. Many others. Shit WILL hit the fan if you tell a racist (a well documented racist) to go fuck themselves though. In defense of the racist, obvi. So sure. Rah rah, Google did an Ida B. Wells doodle. Guaranteed that if Ida Wells were alive & working at Google today, there'd be many private calendar meetings focused on "her future" there.

tl;dr the sharing of one doodle does not a bastion of support for justice and civil disobedience make.

I never heard of "Peer Bonuses" before:

3770 :: What Happens When You Talk About Salaries at Google
Being in management means you see the injustice of salary.  And most of the time you inherit the disparity.  

I remember trying to correct it and being told that it was not a problem that we were hiring in new people for as much or more than the core resource of the group, who had worked for the company for nearly 30 years.  That was just how these things work.  

I spent 5 years working every possible raise I could get approved into her salary in order to get her into a range that made me not embarrassed to look her in the eye at a review.  I never succeeded in getting her paid what she was worth.

That entire thing would NEVER have happened with transparency.  Transparency forces a company to keep equity or justify adequately all inequity. 

But under the carpet inequity works in favor the of the company.  It means they can hire "competitively".  Its hidden in the concept of meritocracy.  But very few salaries seem to correlate to the contribution of the employee, in my experience. 

And the dirty secret is that management is slowly absorbed into the idea because once you are management, you are complicit.  And so you are the one exposed and look bad if its all suddenly transparent.

She mentioned it in the twitter posts but it bears repeating...

In the US it is not just bad to be retaliated against for discussing pay scales with co-workers... it's illegal.  It's also important to note, this is not the kind of illegal where you might merely be able to sue (although you could) but the kind of illegal where people could go to jail.  It's a felony.

So, if you are ever being dismissed because you were discussing pay scales with co-workers (and they are admitting it), get your manager or HR to put that in writing.  Whoever signs that document could serve jail time.

3771 :: FBI hacked the Dark Web to bust 1,500 pedophiles
The FBI only hacked those who tried to sign in on the site. If you accidentally visited it, or never visited it, you were not affected. 

They were able to do this because they had control of the site. They did not hack the Darknet or Tor, they got control of the specific site's server. Poor opsec on the site administrator's part, led to them getting the site. Onion services were also a fun side project done in spare time for Tor devs up until recently, when they announced onion services would become one of the main projects and would be hardened like the Tor Browser Bundle.

Tl;Dr:  Shitty people with poor opsec got their site seized by the FBI and then used to attack it's visitors. The darkweb was not hacked. Shitty opsec on the normal Internet and Tor will result in your site being hacked. 

Edit: Obviously I do not support the site creators and users in anyway and believe they are disgusting human beings. I am attempting to give redditors the non clickbait and summary of what happened, why onion site security for site owners can be difficult at the moment, and that the FBI did not hack the Darknet.

> a public defender for one of the accused told Motherboard. He said he expected at least 1,500 court cases to stem from this one investigation, and called the operation an "extraordinary expansion of government surveillance and its use of illegal search methods on a massive scale," Motherboard reported.

But really, this is how government surveillance is *supposed* to work.

They seized a CP site, tracked the users (with a warrant for their JS exploit, which to me the government should have a warrant to use a known exploit for any reason), and identified them.  

They weren't dragnet recording cell phone convos or using backdoors, but what I want to know though is how they seized the Playpen server in the first place.  If that wasn't legal, all of their cases might be in jeopardy.

They didn't really "hack" it. They confiscated the server and used it as a honeypot.

Note that that has nothing to do with cracking secure connections or anything like that. So that makes it, in principle, OK with me.

"Knowing the IP adresses" when you're in control of the server is nothing. The server *needs* to know the IP address of their peers to be able to send anything back.
But when it's accessed via TOR or something similar, then you get the IP address of the TOR node. Which is useless.

So to move up from there... that might indeed constitute of "hacking". I don't know for sure.

An incredibly misleading headline, one pushed by Netflix.

Show us the poll where subscribers were asked "did you prefer the old Netflix model with more recent movies and TV shows or would you rather watch our original content." 

But I'd like to thank [**Netflix for the end of the grandfathered era,**](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-will-increase-prices-in-may-2016-4) I was already thinking this probably going to be the year I start a cycle of watching their new content (along with things that have been fermenting on my watchlist for too long), cancelling it for like half a year and then re-subscribing when new content has built up again. 

The $2/month increase won't be costing me an extra $24 per year, but saving me around $50. I'd probably do the same with Hulu over the summer as all the network shows go on hiatus, but at least they still have Criterion and Epix movies (the latter courtesy of Netflix, ironically).

So far Netflix has produced some pretty amazing content.  Except for this new one with Ashton Kutcher and the guy from That 70s Show.  That shit (the ranch?) was so terrible I had to turn it off after 5 minutes.  Though I have a feeling that it would appeal to the same crowd that like that 2.5 men show... same style of awful writing and that show was insanely popular for some reason.
10
3766 :: Netflix Subscribers Like Netflix Originals More Than Its Other Content
It's not really an apples to apples comparison since Netflix originals are effectively curated content, created recently and so within the range of material viewers find interesting. The rest of Netflix is a big ball of shit with a few fresh peanuts in it.

3755 :: LinkedIn pays $13m to settle suit regarding excessive emailing, tells...
The suit isn't about "excessive e-mailing" so I don't know what this "lol so ironic" headline is about. It's very specifically about multiple reminder e-mails about pending invites. The e-mails are on the behalf of the person who sent the invite, so it was essentially like LinkedIn was spamming people in user's names.

None of LinkedIn's other e-mails are relevant.

3755 :: LinkedIn pays $13m to settle suit regarding excessive emailing, tells...
From the class action lawsuit:
The Action challenges LinkedIn's use of a service called Add Connections to grow its member base. Add Connections allows LinkedIn members to import contacts from their external email accounts and email connection invitations to one or more of those contacts inviting them to connect on LinkedIn. If a connection invitation is not accepted within a certain period of time, up to two "reminder emails" are sent reminding the recipient that the connection invitation is pending. The Court found that members consented to importing their contacts and sending the connection invitation, but did not find that members consented to LinkedIn sending the two reminder emails. The Plaintiffs contend that LinkedIn members did not consent to the use of their names and likenesses in those reminder emails. LinkedIn denies these allegations and any and all wrongdoing or liability. No court or other entity has made a judgment or other determination of any liability.

Sauce:  I received the CA lawsuit email.

You also have to remember... 'cable' and 'satellite TV' is not a tech product, it's a service. I'm sure the actual cable boxes are cheaper (and more capable: HD and DVR) than before. But as a service, their cost doesn't depend on the hardware, but on bundling entertainment content, which is something that has definitely not gotten cheaper over the last two decades. Content providers charge a lot more now than what they did two decades ago.

None of those things are products. They are services . and all of these things are way, way better than they used to be. Free Internet radio.

The last paragraph sums it up nicely:

> The absurdity of this bill is beyond words. Due to the technical ineptitude of its authors, combined with a hunger for unconstitutional governmental powers, the end result is a very dangerous document that will weaken the security of America’s technology infrastructure. This will affect everything from the iPhone you hold in your pocket to how data is transmitted over the Internet, allowing the government to effectively break all electronic commerce and Internet security. This is bad legislation in every way, and it very subtly allows for unconstitutional government control of private industry. This bill should be seen for the unconstitutional power grab that it is, and never make it to a vote. The Burr-Feinstein bill, in short, punishes American companies for being “too secure”, and forces them to redesign their products to be vulnerable and inferior in security to their foreign competitors – putting everyone at risk.

The title doesn't quite cover the gravity (heh) of this particular landing. This is a very significant landing; this was a Geosynchronous transfer orbit, which is a (significantly) higher orbit than the ISS and requires a lot of fuel and speed to get to (for comparison, the Falcon 9 can get 50,265 lbs to LEO and the ISS, but only 18,300 lbs to GTO). 

These are the kind of orbits that will be required to transfer cargo into lunar or interplanetary (Martian) orbits. They leave the first stage coming in for landing much faster and with significantly less fuel than the Apr. 8th launch (or as Elon put it, they're re-entering "a lot faster and hotter" than any previous landing), which gives a significantly lower chance of successful landing.

This shows that they've got the landings (mostly) down, even if they're low on fuel and high on re-entry speed.

How is this supposed to work if ISPs consistently whitelist speedtest sites so that you get blazing fast speedtest results but your real world data transfers are poor.
56
3736 :: The NY attorney general is crowdsourcing speed tests to see if Verizo...
Just as a public service announcement, for everyone testing your speed, it should be tested at your modem if you have a separate modem and router, and the speed check itself should be done direct to the ISP (ie, downloading a file from an ISP ftp server). Not from a website. Also, should not use WiFi when testing download speed. 

The ISP can't reasonably guarantee certain download/upload speeds to sites it doesn't control, over links that it doesn't own. 

A distinction should also be made between latency and bandwidth. Bandwidth(XXMbps) is not technically "speed", its the amount of data that can be transmitted at a time. If that data is taking 800 milliseconds to reach its destination, its still going to seem "slow" and have a negative affect on your experience. 

Also Mbps (megabits per second) is not MBps (megaBYTES per second). There are 8 bits in 1 byte. So 100Mbps is 12.5 Megabytes per second. Giant difference if your results are being returned to you in megabytes but your being advertised to as megabits.

Cablevision does not throttle customers. they did like 5 years or more ago but they do not now. If you get lower then advertised speeds it is usually due to an overcrowded node. You can also help speeds by making sure you have a docsis 3.0 modem.

> Then it looked at Nielsen data, which showed that the typical hour of cable TV includes 15 minutes and 38 seconds of commercials.

Another way of putting this is that commercial driven TV charges you 1 hour of work (watching commercials) for every 3 hours of TV.

So if your after-tax pay is $10 an hour, you pay $3/hr equivalent in wasted time to watch commercial TV.   

Now (after some googling) a half-hour episode Big Bang Theory makes $6.5M per show, to 16 million viewers, so that each viewer seems to be worth about 40 cents in advertising.  But the ads cost each viewer about $1.50 in wasted time.      Somehow, $1.10 is wasted - viewers would be better off  just paying 40 cents each.

This makes me mad for no other reason than I had both before the merger, and now AT&T is making DirecTV shitty.  Tip, do not merge your accounts, I got a bill for $750 more than it should have been.  I've spent about 5 hours on the phone resolving this and other issues.  It also breaks your logins to prove your TV provider for things like Apple TV, Roku, websites, etc.

AT&T, I tolerate, DirecTV I loved, but AT&T is already messing them up.  It hasn't gotten to the service yet, but DirecTV was the bar I used for good customer service, but now AT&T is lowering that bar because you can't reach DirecTV legacy employees much anymore, and all the processes are broken.

The challenge will be if I would buy it again, I'm not in the habit of buying shit tasting food, if the taste is right, and the price is right, you'll find me as a customer, if it's expensive and/or shite tasting I wouldn't buy it (just like any other food!).

I believe this would be one of the major milestones of our journey towards a more advanced species.

Every single animal in this world depends on killing and consuming other living things in order to survive. This is an essential part of living. 

As humans, we have tamed and cultured many of our animalistic behaviors in order to advance our species, but this dependency; the fact that we kill other animals for a living remains essentially the same.

If we manage to grow our non-sentient, man-made meat, it will truly be an achievement that would really separate us from our earthen roots and ancestors.

So they want to capture UV and IR light and use them in transparent panels. Right off the bat, 90% of the energy is gone because visible light is the dominant wavelengths produced by the Sun and UV is mostly absorbed by the atmosphere. 

Further compounding the problem, you want to put them on the sides of buildings. This cuts the efficiency by half or more of a roof top panel and even worse for solar tracking. 

If existing solar tracking designs are just barely profitable,I doubt this idea would be even if we achieved 100% efficiency. The physics behind how much raw energy gets to the surface in those wavelengths and architectural limitations both are hammering nails in this coffin.

This'll send me to reddit hell, but Musk and Jobs are/were, first and foremost, master marketers.

Look at Falcon Heavy - it's been 2 years away every year since 2011. 

But that's what they're good at - building this image and persona and following, and from it they can dangle the carrot in front of followers with big promises all the while obscuring problems and their own shortfalls. In particular, they are big at selling how innovative they are to the crowd that deems themselves tech savvy, but may not have in depth knowledge of the actual technology or industry.

Take for instance, the aerospace industry. SpaceX reputation within it isnt as great as it is to outsiders. It's interesting that both Musk and Jobs are known to have abrasive personalities and push their workers hard. SpaceX alone has had multiple lawsuits filed against them for working conditions these last few years. 

Yet people keep wanting to work for them, because of the reputation/larger than life persona they've built. Thus as workers burn out, quit, or leave due to working conditions, the hype train keeps pulling in the next group willing to work more for less.

3693 :: Solar Prices to Reach $1 per Watt Target 3 Years Early
Solar Guy here. The pricing in this article is directly referring to utility scale projects. The average cost/watt for residential solar in 2010 was around $5/watt. The average price in central Texas is now around $3.20/watt. The average price last year was also around $3.20/watt. The prices of solar modules stalled after the Chinese tariff. I have noticed cheaper solar modules on the market lately but there is usually a catch such as not having a ul listing or the company is out of business.

A good american module like solarworld costs about .95/watt. A decent quality Chinese module is around .75/watt and sunpower is closer to 1.65/watt.

Now is the definitely the time to buy but I am obviously a bit biased. The Federal Tax Credit could expire next year if politicians don't extend it. Don't be that guy calling me on December 2016 because it will be too late and every company in town will be back logged.

one thing to keep in mind is these benefits are all designed to keep people working longer, and not worrying about other things. But I still think it is a great thing. many companies you end up working long hours and having to worry about things like laundry dinner health child care etc. make your life much more stressful. So taking care of a lot of that on site at work makes it easier to work longer and harder with less stress.

"Internet software and Internet catalog retail industries" is not "all online revenue"

This puts total internet revenue at $300 B per year. I don't understand how they are calculating total revenue? I think 300 B sounds much too low. There's tons of small sources of revenue which add up. It only counts publicly traded companies, and I'm not sure how they account for what is internet revenue vs non-internet. Is that US only?

All it really shows is how fucking stupid it is to have a list of internet companies, because the power of the internet is not in spawning completely new areas of work, but in massively changing how nearly all our business, money communications has been happening.

This is the most important statement to me.

In fact,  by gathering and centralizing our data, installing back doors and disrupting encryption standards, ironically, they've made the population more vulnerable rather than safer.

Snowden did what was right. The government has no right in violating the rights of law abiding citizens. Technology has become a blessing as well as a curse. It has made daily life easier, but it has also made it easier for those in higher levels of government to keep tabs on everyone. The government has no business worrying about what it's citizens are  doing as the majority of us have not been suspected of committing a crime. That's what warrants are for. I would love to see Snowden come back to the States with a hero's welcome, but that will never happen under this current administration. 
27
3673 :: Snowden leaks confirm: CISA is a surveillance bill
The gist of this article is that CISA could theoretically allow the NSA to gather private information, but only if a hacker steals it first, and the NSA then finds it while investigating the hacker.

That's a bit silly, and it certainly isn't the evident intent of CISA. But it's possibly true.

The title here is very misleading. All the Snowden leak document talks about is the fact that, under current wiretap laws, often law enforcement can't even get involved in cybercrime at all. Doing any investigation whatsoever (looking at firewall logs, etc.) can be argued as an illegal wiretap. That's a problem various agencies have talked about for years. It isn't some evil secret. It's a legal conundrum that has resulted in businesses having to tackle cybercrime entirely on their own without any law enforcement assistance, unlike other crimes.

Perhaps since everybody wants our data, there should be some rules around your privacy that all these online security disclaimers cannot abrogate.  For example, they should have a surety bond that covers any loss that you incur from their using your data and rules around what that means.  There should be an explicit quid pro quo wherein their use of your data constitutes a taking that can be valued at some number of dollars per occurrence by statute.  And there should be some way to use the software with giving up all your data.  And they should pay for running their software on your computers.

Basically, they all take your data; some charge you for the software on top of it; some do not do so explicitly; and there are few rules around their responsibility to protect you data.

If the politicians were not in the pocket of big business they would be more worried about this than Digital Rights management for hollywood and other big business.

Yeah, I am just ranting but it would be nice if anybody was looking out for us victims.

3670 :: Windows 10 Worst Feature Installed On Windows 7 And Windows 8
1. The host file has been ignored for a long time by microsoft tools / services last I checked.

2. Most if not all Privacy concerns can be handled by shutting the tools off

3. You can set up a local account instead of a Microsoft account

And that is a good start. If you are very paranoid, go into your router and put network level blocks on all IP's and domains microsoft uses (*.microsoft.* is a good start).

>the clear benefit of Windows 7 and Windows 8 at this point is updates are not mandatory.

If you want privacy, security is key - and for security to be valid, you need security patches. Being many people failed to update their systems regularly, perhaps this is actually not a terrible idea. A few people I know have purchased and are happily using windows 10 devices without issue. In fact, they are happy that the Updates just kinda happen in the back ground, and let them get back to work.

Could the tools for setting install times be better? Yes - Say on next restart, or next shutdown would be a good time to do it. Shutdown => Install => Soft start to configure => Power off would be a good process for it to follow, and would be user friendly. Being able to have soft service restarts without requiring the machine to reboot to install would also be beneficial.

And then finally about privacy - many people use the following:

- Facebook

- Google Search

- Gmail

- Youtube

- Reddit

- Wikipedia

- Amazon

- Twitter

And so goes the list. Each and everyone of these websites is tracking you in some way or other. Perhaps not directly - but indirectly, I can guarantee it happens. What people are talking about is useful information, even if you can't put a name and face to the content.

If you are complaining about privacy but do not sanitize your data before posting (stripping name, locations, faces, local connections and social circles, gps data and so on) - You are plastering your life WILLFULLY on the internet. Complaining about Microsoft grabbing (most likely) anonymized, sanitized data to understand what services, tools and so forth that the average person uses and how they use it - is kind of pointless.

If you do have a problem with the tracking that is done - A few things to do:

- Shut off every setting in windows 10 that states it sends data to microsoft

- Black list every IP / domain that microsoft uses for their services - EXCEPT for the core update service (using a router or other NAT device)

And you are done. Microsoft will no longer have a feasible way of tracking you. But really, just go and install Ubuntu or another Linux distro with a healthy community and support. If you browse the internet, and do some emails - it will do everything you need it to, and then some. Especially with the slow but steady movement of SteamOS and the drive towards better Linux Drivers and hardware support.

But even then - your ISP is tracking you.

**TL;DR**

If you are worried about tracking, do the research, get the tools in order and do something about it - It's more then possible these days. But if you plaster your life on Facebook, stop being a hypocrite - you are willfully providing people the means to know everything about you. And I'd wager Facebook would sell everything they know about you to any and every company that offers a high enough price.

Yes, they're going to keep pushing win10 updates and telemetry. But here's a way to clean your windows machine of upgrade and telemetry updates with what we know today:

[Don't do this if you ever plan to upgrade to 10]

    wusa /uninstall /KB:2952664 /norestart /quiet
    wusa /uninstall /KB:2990214 /norestart /quiet

    wusa /uninstall /KB:3075249 /norestart /quiet
    wusa /uninstall /KB:3080149 /norestart /quiet

You can save that as a .bat file and run it. You may need to run as administrator. Or you can just run each command in the console (drop /quiet to see output).

Go back into the windows update tool, find any of these numbers, then right-click and select "Hide update". You won't see it offered again (unless they change the KB number).

3668 :: Freightliner unveils the first road-legal self-driving truck
Truck driver here, I'm looking forward to the day I can set auto pilot on the highway or in traffic. People can point the finger at truckers all they want, but the majority of crashes are not the fault of the truck driver. People cut me off all day long, swerve around me like I'm sitting still. But if I hit them, chances are I'll get blamed because I'm the "professional" driver.

Sure falling asleep at the wheel happens, this would help with that for sure. The way I see it, these trucks can only drive themselves in daylight and in good road conditions so I could sleep during the day and drive at night. Although this generation of self driving trucks still require you to be in the driver seat, so for now that idea is ruled out.

A good portion of my driving is off road through fields, sometimes requiring tire chains. If you go through the mountains in the winter there is a good chance of needing tire chains. Stopping is not an option. If the highway is still passable you must go. Trucks stop moving, the world stops moving. Going around is possible in some cases but for me the next way to get through the mountains is 4 hours out of the way and could take 2x as long.

As for more train transport, we already do have more and more products shipping by rail, but it will never be enough. Also, rail is much slower. Rail is fine if you only need your shipment in about a month, but if you need it overnight or in the same week, truck is the only way to go.

I don't think we'll see completely self driving trucks in our generation, self driving cars though I can definitely see in the near future. But maybe not 100% self driving. Think of the movie iRobot, Will Smith's car was doing 200+ mph on auto pilot. Those speeds will never be safe for a truck, but if they rethink the road infrastructure and make the left lane on a highway an autopilot lane for cars, you could potentially do 200+ mph in a car because everyone in that lane would be doing the same speed.

I remember a post a while back about the most common jobs, by state, across the U.S. and how it's changed. 

Truck driver is now the most common job in most of the continental United States, especially in the Midwest / West.

What will happen once the most common jobs are replaced by technology? Massive unemployment and social unrest.

I would bet that congress will outlaw self driving trucks solely because it's the number one job and the country can't handle that much unemployment.

What we need are more government initiatives to push use to more renewable energy and ways in which we can slow and or reverse the process of climate change which is also happening in the world.

Netflix has been under-priced for a long time (even when they increased their mid plan to 8.99!) They are the $1.50 Costco hotdog/soda equivalent of subscription services.  

But it is very consumer friendly how they increase prices.  They do it very slowly already, and when they do, they let existing customers phase into the new pricing even slower, and they even continue to offer the old price under another service (with slightly less features) available to customers where the price is really a deal breaker.

>Prime Minister David Cameron, who this week fired off a broadside against adult content providers who he says are failing to control what other people’s children are viewing online.

Excuse me? But when did it become their resposibility to act like these kids parents. These children HAVE PARENTS that should be doing that job. We do not and should not live in a nanny state. The parents need to take control of what their children do plain and simple. Maybe make the tools to control what the kids do online be easy to get and use, but to just blanket block stuff just because the parents are to lazy to take care of their children is wrong.

Sad part is children can still find ways to access porn if they want so all that was done was annoy people and maybe, just maybe stopped a small handful of kids and adults.

It's like the congestion being experienced was artificial and contrived to help justify internet fast lanes. Really it was certain ISPs who were either A) refusing to update infrastructure or B) purposely taking down enough BGP peering links during peek traffic times to "statistically prove" that the traffic traversing their network was maxing out their total capable throughput/bandwidth.

And then the other networking experts from smaller ISPs came out with more than enough ample proof to show that, yes, it was the case that perfectly healthy BGP peerings were dropping, and we're only doing so during peak hours.

This is the result of Verizon being a huge conglomerate (like Comcast, but not *quite* as bad) whose feet are too far away from its head to ever communicate, even when the implementation benefits far and away exceed the implementation costs for a given feature/installation. They just dont want to pick up their own hand to grab money in front of their face.

Story time: I used to be at a student at, and then later an IT employee for, a private university. It was in the PERFECT location to construct cell antennas: the campus had the tallest buildings around for miles, we already had a robust fiber infrastructure, and it was right in the middle of a large residential area that \*surprise\* had horrible Verizon cell service. Students and staff with Verizon phones that were inside ANY buildings on campus did not have any signal (no, i dont mean 1 bar. i mean straight up "no service"). \*Surprise\* AT&T and Sprint both knew the location benefits of the university and had already negotiated to put a tower on one of the school's buildings, so everyone on campus, inside or outside of buildings (even concrete basements built in the 40s) would have service, plus it served the surrounding community.

Our IT department and VP leadership tried to get Verizon to install a tower, we even offered up the tallest building. *They wanted US to pay for it*. So we told them to get lost, and in the meantime they couldn't find another location to install a tower in the dense residential area

This was in Long Beach CA, so i always wonder if Grant Imahara or Jamie Hyneman were there.  It's only about a 6 hour drive from San Fran.  I might have met some of the mythbusters before there was a mythbusters.

Google would benefit from faster wireless internet without data caps; AT&T and Verizon would not.  They all participated in suggesting amendments to the legislation.  Do you really believe it was Google that slipped those in?  It's far more likely that Google wanted to pull those exceptions, but couldn't because these other "partners" would try to derail the whole thing.  These compromises happen all the time in politics to let the bigger idea move forward.


Google isn't responding for comment because these guys (good or bad) are little nobodies, and public statements take lots of resources (review by branding and legal depts).  Google has more to lose than gain by responding, unless big media gets involved.


This "article" gives very little real information and is written like an attack.  Just as with Fox and CNN, consider that there's an agenda afoot.

This is unpopular on reddit but it makes sense. Because Google understands a free internet can't have regulation. We give the governments an ounce of control and they'll slowly ruin what makes it great.

Google instead wanted large competition so fiber came in to kick ass and take names. As it spreads it will do just that forcing other isps to increase speeds and remain neutral. Google needs a neutral net for its business model to work. But it also needs a free internet.

3589 :: Google Lobbied Against Real Net Neutrality In India, Just Like It Did...
Big online services have less to fear from ISP attack than startups because they have the money, userbase, and brand recognition to hold onto their turf. In fact they might actually benefit from a throttled, blocked, and tollled Internet because it raises the barrier of entry and makes it harder for pesky startups to compete with them. If YouTube is able to stay unmolested because of a backroom deal but examplevideosite gets throttled, Google doesn't need to agitate for NN.

This is the largest danger of not having NN. ISPs won't directly attack the established services by blocking or throttling as that will cause a backlash. Instead they set the pattern for a racket where they demand a cut of the revenue made on the Internet. New services won't be able to pay this troll toll and they'll just wither on the vine. The services of tomorrow will never come into existence and the marketplace will stagnate just so ISPs can benefit at the expense of everyone else.

3568 :: The European Union Parliament just dealt a major blow to net neutrality
Just to make it clear: they voted FOR net neutrality rules, but didn't approve amendments that would close some 'loopholes' that could maybe possibly lead to abuses. However, it remains very much to be seen if any ISP would dare to abuse these loopholes, because they can be sued if they don't adhere to the intention of net neutrality laws.

To be more concrete: one possible loophole is an exemption for special services like remote medical procedures or self-driving cars, and an ISP could try to label their own streaming service as a specialised service to undercut competition. However, they would need to give a damn good reason why their service qualifies as specialised service while the competition doesn't, and it's very likely they would be sued for breaking the rules.

Finally, these laws will already prevent most of the problems associated with a lack of net neutrality, even accounting for the loopholes.

As long as we don't speak up, they will keep taking us for a ride. Now is the big need to arrange those internet black-outs and communicate our displeasure in every possible manner. 

The danger in the long term is that they will keep pushing it bit by bit and before we know, we would have started accepting blatant violation of net-neutrality as just another fact in existence.
175
3568 :: The European Union Parliament just dealt a major blow to net neutrality
Alot of misinformation going around here. I would encourage people to read the actual Regulation in stead of the news articles. Skip the preamble and start reading at 'article 1'

http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-10788-2015-INIT/en/pdf

You will notice that what happened is they actually did vote for net neutrality. Just not as absolute a version as some people had hoped for.

Concerns that are being raised in these news articles range from speculative to downright wrong.
274
3568 :: The European Union Parliament just dealt a major blow to net neutrality
Other advocates cautiously welcomed the legislation but stressed that the European Commission needs now to work on closing the loopholes. "For most member states this [legislation] means that, for the first time ever, net neutrality will receive some sort of protection in their country," said Dutch privacy advocate Rejo Zenger of Bits of Freedom. "For the Netherlands, unfortunately, this means a step back: our strong protection will be overridden by the European regulation, which features at least four loopholes." 

Now that the legislation has been approved by the European Parliament, the Body of European Regulators (BEREC) now has nine months to create guidelines for individual nations. "The European Commission and BEREC's interpretation will determine to which extent the freedom of the internet user is protected under these new rules," said Zenger. "We will need to convince the [Commission] to close the loopholes that are still present." [[1]](http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9619962/eu-net-neturality-vote)

>"The proposal allows ISPs to define classes and speed up or slow down traffic in those classes, even if there is no congestion." ISPs could still choose to discriminate against certain kinds of data (like peer-to-peer torrenting, for example). Van Schewick worries that because ISPs will not be able to identify what "class" encrypted data fits in, they will simply put them in the slowest lane — as has happened before. This will discourage the use of encryption, and make the internet less secure.


Ok this sounds false to me. Here's the legal jargon pertaining specifically to that claim, courtesy of another poster in the thread:

>'In an open internet, providers of electronic communications to the public internet access services should, within contractually agreed limits on data volumes and speeds for internet access services, **not block, slow down, degrade or discriminate against** specific content, applications or services **or specific classes** thereof except for a limited number of reasonable traffic management measures'

It sounds like the exact opposite of what the article is claiming, that ISPs can't discriminate between 'classes' of services either, with 'reasonable' exceptions.

3562 :: Paypal froze our funds, then offered us a business loan
I sold about 80% of my sneaker collection on eBay a few years back. Just had our second kid and we were looking to buy a house.  I had been selling stuff here and there on eBay for a while so I was out of the whole "we hold your funds because your new" stage with PayPal. Everything is going cool at first, after the couple of weeks just about everything I listed is sold. Everybody got their stuff, I'm ready to move the money to my actual bank account. 

All total its just under $9000. I check PayPal, it's says my funds are on hold and I need to contact them. I call and they tell me the funds are on hold due to "suspicious activity". I'm like wtf are you talking about, it's all from eBay sales, you can see all the transactions. They we're having none of it, and said that they had to "investigate" before they release the funds. I called countless times until finally a month later they release the funds. Fucking nightmare experience and I havent sold a thing on ebay since

211
3562 :: Paypal froze our funds, then offered us a business loan
PayPal is a joke. My account was hacked a few months ago and someone moved about $1000 in to my PayPal account from my bank account. I called PayPal, they said they couldn't do anything to stop it other than freeze that money so it can only move back to my bank account. So I have to wait several days for the money to get in to PayPal and then transfer it back to my bank. Then, a day or two later, another transaction shows up showing PayPal sent the money back to my bank account as well. 

My PayPal account at this point had gone from $0 (I wasn't using it) to $1000, then back to $0, then to -$1000. After saying they couldn't do anything, they also moved the funds back to my bank. Money that in theory, did not exist, because I had already moved it.  

Then of course, they call me every 20 minutes at work telling me that I owe them $1000. $1000 that they pulled out of thin air and put in my bank account after telling me that it was impossible for them to move money to my bank account. 
43
3562 :: Paypal froze our funds, then offered us a business loan

74
3562 :: Paypal froze our funds, then offered us a business loan
There are so many stories like this on sites like paypalsucks.com that I think only a naive fool would sell using Paypal for anything significant. Story after story after story. Sure, some of them are probably the fault of the person, but so many are the fault of Paypal. These stories go back long before even eBay owned them. Nothing has changed.

If you have, say, $5,000 in your Paypal account and there is a dispute about $50, Paypal will gladly freeze your entire account. Actually, a dispute is not required to freeze your account, just some algorithm in their system is enough. 

So you say, just don't let your account get that high a balance. For someone with a lot of sales, that's easier said than done. And that won't protect you anyway. If they want to do a chargeback, they'll just take it out of your checking/savings account. You think draining THAT account will protect you? Think again. Paypal will just make multiple attempts to withdraw the money anyway, and you'll rack up huge overdraft fees.

If you have a checking/savings account attached to your Paypal account and you're not an active seller, remove it. That is your only protection.

3546 :: Adblock Plus is now letting ads by Google and Microsoft pass through ...
The symbol in the article (red "stop" octagon with a hand) is for Adblock, not Adblock plus. They are two completely different ad-blockers.

1477
3546 :: Adblock Plus is now letting ads by Google and Microsoft pass through ...
Not news - Adblock Plus has been allowing non-intrusive ads for years to drive ad networks to be less annoying for all .. and earn themselves some money while at it.

An example of non-intrusive ads that Adblock Plus allows are the reddit ads. The default installation of Adblock Plus whitelists them as non-intrusive. And because reddit is not a huge ads serving company this did not cost reddit anything.

**Update:** After posting as one of the first, on something I thought everyone and their cat already knew about, this blew up (it's on the frontpage now) , so it seems that even though this is very old news, a lot of people haven't heard about it or they just like to get outraged.  
And so for all you guys.. please lower your pitchforks while I go into further details:

“Allow non-intrusive advertising” was added to Adblock Plus with version 2.0 - which came out in [December 2011](https://adblockplus.org/releases/adblock-plus-20-released). Yes almost 4 years ago - that is how old news this is.

It's not a thing that Adblock Plus have been trying to sneak by you. It mentions this on the front page of the [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), it is in it's list of features, it mentions it on the extension pages in both Firefox and Chrome, during installation and it's available as a setting that you can toogle if you don't want to allow these ads.

Adblock Plus has a [FAQ about this on their website](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads).

From this feature in Adblock Plus it has grown to become an [Internet manifesto](https://acceptableads.org/) with other companies and organizations (reddit being one of them) supporting it and promising to work towards an Internet where the ads that the sites need to generate income and survive are not annoying but are relevant to the site or content you are reading.

Try disabling your adblocker now and refresh reddit to see what qualifies as a non-intrusive ads here on reddit.  
It's easy to think that nothing has changed because the ads are really that non-intrusive, but look to the sidebar on the right and scroll down.

You will find a 300 by 250 pixel image, that usually advertises a small but upcoming subreddit that you might not have discovered, or a reddit meetup or a new reddit Secret Santa or something else that is relevant to the reddit community. Sometimes it's just some picture of a cute kitten .. *awww kitten :)* - many of these are coming from the /r/NonAds/ subreddit.  

On occasion it's even an actual product, that you can discuss here on reddit and either say how much you hate or love it, but most of the time it's reddit community content that you are missing out on if you turn off the whitelisting of reddit.com

I think it's good that someone is trying to find a compromise between showing ads and allowing users some peace of mind and privacy, instead of scamming them and annoying the hell out of everyone.  
And if you don't agree then it can easily be turned off so all ads are removed.

Now you might think that I recommend you stay with Adblock Plus - I'm not.  
You SHOULD switch - but not because of the non-intrusive ads feature but because Adblock Plus is a memory hog.  
That said Firefox 41 was just released and it introduces [a feature that will greatly reduce the memory overhead of Adblock Plus](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2015/07/01/firefox-41-will-use-less-memory-when-running-adblock-plus/).  
Even so I suggest you switch to uBlock Origin which is just as good at removing ads as Adblock Plus but is faster and uses much less memory.

But since you already have your pitchforks out .. there is actually something to get outraged about here.  
Because while Yahoo is trying to anger you against Adblock Plus (to make people distrust adblockers no doubt) and their acceptable ads feature, they are at the same time serving some of the worst ads for scams I have seen on a mayor network.

I tried turning off my adblocker on that Yahoo "news article" and I'm hit with clickbait ads for scams like "EXPOSED: *[subject hometown here]* Mum Makes *[subject currency and huge amount here]*/Month From Home And You Won't Believe How She Does It! " - as it turns out all you have to do is order this easy starter kit for the low low price of *[your soul]* and you can be making EASY money from home without any real work.

It's been a long time since Yahoo was a relevant company that was beneficial to the Internet - now they just serve dubious articles with content they borrowed from other sites, and then serve you lots of clickbait and ads.

Saying Adblock Plus sold out to Google, while Yahoo themselves sold out to scammers is the worst kind of hypocrisy.

**Fuck you Yahoo!**

OK, I'm done ranting.

3546 :: Adblock Plus is now letting ads by Google and Microsoft pass through ...
I'm okay with ads that are only in one part of the screen, don't try and hijack what you are doing on the page, don't have popups, are collapsible, don't have video or audio components, don't have fake close buttons, don't have deceptive components that mimic the content of the page you are looking at (download button) or mimic your OS/browser, require double click or double tap to open to differentiate from actual webpage components, aren't scams, don't contain malware or phishing, and comply with local advertising regulations. 

I'm okay with Adblock companies blocking 99.9999% of the ads and allowing only those that meet the above criteria through. 

I'm okay with Adblock companies charging users to remove the remainder of ads that fit the above criteria.

The developers used the users password to generate both a bcrypt-hash and a md5-hash. They were in other words encrypting the password using two different algorithms and storing them in the same table, one of which being easy to decrypt?

I am curious about what seems to be some intense hatred toward Aaron in this discussion.  It is like people ignore entirely what the government did to him for two years, even after both MIT and JSTOR dropped all charges.  He was hounded with thirteen felonies and decades of prison time, in an attempt to further the careers of overzealous prosecutors.

I pray none of us, even those belittling Aaron Swartz, ever have to go through that.  Those prosecutors and the laws that made their bullying possible are what people should be hating, not Aaron, it is pathetic.  I don't care if you think he was a prodigy or not, just listening to him speak was worthwhile, regardless of his background.

It's just common sense, really.

Capitalism depends on the economics of scarcity. We're already stretching it to its limits with the concept of intellectual property and digital ownership, things which are by their nature *not scarce*.

What do you think is going to happen when you automate 80+% of labor? There will be no demand for unskilled labor. Imagine if everyone had to get Masters degrees in order to find employment? It doesn't work. If you're going on the US system where you have to enter into debt to get an education, then you're creating an even deeper hole and effective serfdom. If you're going the European system and socializing education, then you're setting up a welfare system just short of basic income in order to create a working class.

Capitalism and "peak automation" are fundamentally incompatible. If you don't begin converting to a socialist society now, you're going to see extreme poverty and an economic depression unlike any before in history.

Details I read elsewhere say that you aren't seeing the popups because you didn't buy their modem, but said that you are seeing the popups because the modem you bought isn't capable of the speeds you're paying for.

Edit: I'm keenly aware of modem models at the moment because (although I don't have comcast) I had to upgrade from a 4 channel modem to a 16 channel Docsis 3.0 modem to get the speeds I am paying for.  Some people don't realize that and need to be told. (Even if Comcast could find better ways to do so.)

As much as I hate Comcast, this article is basically wrong. If you have your own modem and it's DOCSIS3, you don't get popups. If it's not, you do get popups.

Yes, the popups are annoying. But you're also probably overpaying for speed and not getting it, so while the method may be shit, Comcast is actually doing something good for once.

3498 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...
Hi, I wrote the original article that made it to the front page yesterday and I disagree. Actually, I think this article is a lot more misleading by saying that "Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla". Ford is clearly opening its patents. Not exactly like Tesla, but they still are making them accessible.

**Big companies don't always license their patents like OP's article is suggesting.** They actually often use their patents to block competitors from developing similar technologies. Ford is saying they will not do that, instead they will work with others.

BTW, if Tesla was to help competitors implement their tech, I'm pretty sure they would ask to be compensated too. When you license your tech, normally you lends some engineers familiar with the tech to help implement it to the product. The difference is that Tesla made it clear that if someone were to use their tech, in good faith, they wouldn't sue. In other words, they will not use patents for their technology slowing capability. Ford didn't make that clear.

But the most important thing to take away from this situation is that Ford is showing their intent to work with others to develop EV technologies.
423
3498 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...
Such a disingenuous article -- it's suggesting that Ford was trying to mislead folks.  See [Ford's press release](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/05/28/ford-opens-portfolio-of-patented-technologies-to-competitors-to-.html) on the matter, which clearly addresses both of the criticisms.

- Says in the first line (emphasis added), and elsewhere in the press release: "Ford Motor Company is offering competitors access to its **electrified vehicle technology patents**"

- The quote in the article is actually lifted from from a paragraph in the press release!!  Woah, they really dug deep to catch Ford's deception:  "To access Ford’s patents and published patent applications, interested parties can contact the company’s technology commercialization and licensing office, or work through AutoHarvest – an automaker collaborative innovation and licensing marketplace. [...] **The patents would be available for a fee**."

38
3498 :: Ford Pretends To Open Up Its Patents Like Tesla, But Doesn't; Media F...
Yeah, I still don't buy Tesla's offer, either.

There are several things that Tesla could do to "walk the talk" with its patent offer:

1) It could expressly abandon its patents. All it takes is a one-page form filed with the USPTO.

2) It could publish, on its website, a form that grants a free, irrevocable license to its patents, already signed by Tesla. Just download the form and sign it, and *poof*, free license.

3) It could create a standards body to grant free patent licenses for companies that implement the technology "fairly," according to some definition. Exhibit A for why standards bodies work: Wi-Fi, which is managed by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Tesla hasn't taken any of those steps. Its sole action, literally, has been Musk's PR pledge not to sue anyone... which has no legally binding value whatsoever. Tesla could easily change its mind - or get bought out by another auto maker with a different agenda.

So while this pledge has conferred a ton of PR feel-good vibes on Tesla, it's legally meaningless.

Meanwhile, there are signs that Tesla might not quite mean what it says... like the fact that [it keeps pursuing and paying for new patents](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=tesla$.ASNM.&OS=an/tesla$&RS=AN/tesla$). Tesla has won, and paid the issue fee for, three new patents in May 2015, and six new patents in March 2015. Why would it maintain such extensive (and expensive!) efforts to expand its patent portfolio if it has no plans to enforce any of them, ever?

I'm really not sure how "free" Teslas patents are...

Someone [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/37l3n6/ford_follows_teslas_lead_and_opens_all_their/crnp0gr) this yesterday:


> Well, to be fair, that's a press release (direct quote from their blog, actually), not a contract. Check their [legal page](https://www.teslamotors.com/about/legal) for a definition of good faith, or contact Tesla for a patent license. Don't make business decisions based on a press release.

> A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:

> * asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;

> * challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or

> * marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.

What I got from that:

* If  you use any Tesla patent and then later you both happen to clash on some other patent in an area where you both do research then you lose the right to the old Tesla patent if you challenge Tesla.

* And you basically give Tesla the right to use all your patents, because you can't assert them against them anymore?

I can't believe this shit actually happens. "*The people are asleep! Let's get rid of this net neutrality quick, guys!*" Sounds like redditors in a fucking sub breaking the rules when the mods are offline. 

I am Canadian, but I sure as hell bet our government is pulling shit like this too. They think they can just sneak in changes and people won't notice? That is some seriously arrogant, backwards shit.  That is explicitly going against the public. There's no ambiguity. There are no grey areas. Just fucking indifference to the public. That is a disgrace. Where the hell do they get off?

I'm stuck at work and on my phone, but I'll put the relevant contact links I placed in the Julian massage post here as well. All of these types of bills -- the ones that sneak anti-net neutrality laws by -- need to have the people speak out against them. Yes, its hard and inefficient, but it's the only civil way at the moment. I'm almost counting the days until peaceful protests become necessary to get the point across.

The DOJ should be able to knock this bill on its ass. Insidious greed. The constant bribing (lobbying) is ridiculous.  What needs to stop in this next generation is the practice of hiding bills within bills. It would require an Amendment whose supporters will pledge to vote for it when in office or face removal from office.  Over everything else--the dysfunction of Congress can be broken.  Then the abuses of filibustering and gerrymandering districts must be stopped.

I'm sure that most, if not all of these facts are true, and that it'll likely harm US manufacturing a lot, as well as other corporate things. At the same time, since the text of the TPP agreement has not been released, I wonder how much of it is actually true, and how much is part crazy conspiracy theorist theories. Ugh, all my crazy conspiracy theorists acquaintances who think things like 9/11, WWII, Moon landing/etc are all faked and manipulation believe this stuff, I really have some doubts.

I haven't seen anything in TPP so far that hasn't been in other FTAs or BITs since 1970s.

Corporate arbitration and ISDS are pretty boilerplate in most trade negotiations. As are IP rights, worker protection, and royalty guarantees (to varying degrees).

Would love to hear from someone more familiar with the matter on why TPP is so different. The author of this article doesn't seem to really know why.

3472 :: Stop Calling the TPP a Trade Agreement – It Isn’t - TPP is a corporat...
"Trade agreement" has a specific legal meaning, it doesn't mean it is about "trade".  It just means the president can enter into the agreement on behalf of the U.S. without Congressional approval.  Unlike treaties, trade agreements don't overwrite existing federal law, but they become law in areas where federal law is silent.  

So please, do continue to call it a trade agreement so people know exactly how big of a threat it is.  To reiterate, the danger here is that the president can unilaterally enter into the agreement and that it will still have binding effect unless Congress explicitly overrides it.

3479 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16
How does it do against 5 guys who were farmers two weeks ago in a rusty pickup truck?
2109
3479 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16
The F-35 is not designed for dog fighting. The F-35 is designed as a BVR - Beyond Visual Range - fighter. It's design makes it faster and gives ita longer range and linger time, although it does sacrifice maneuverability. The idea is that the F-35 would simply shoot down any aircraft that tried to close with it before dog fighting range could be reached.

The F-16 was designed for a time when modern stealth and radar made dog fighting a possibly common situation. These days, almost every fighter aircraft is designed to operate at the BVR range. 

Also remember that the F-35 is not a dedicated interceptor/ fighter, it's a multi-role. It must also be concerned with supporting ground units. Now I know a lot of people are upset that the A-10 is being replaced by the F-35, but again, we're fighting in a new arena. The A-10 has never faced off against a modern, substantial air threat. The A-10 has never been in a situation where it has had to fight its way into a combat zone to provide air support. 

Let's say we go to war with France. How many A-10s could survive on their own in that theater? The US military is historically extremely offensive. Our ground forces tend to push further, faster than expected. How many times since the 1940s have the USMC or Army advanced beyond what they were supposed to and gotten themselves surrounded? If you don't know, the answer is like... pretty much any time they're on the attack. So let's say the US Army is advancing on Paris, and oops, they're in Paris. They went faster than they were supposed to and note the French army is closing in. They're going to need a lot of fire support. But oh no, we haven't won air superiority. Our soldiers advanced out of our envelope of air support because we expected them to take a bit longer to reach France and the Air Force is a tad tied up. Do we send the A-10, so it can be shot out of the sky before it can even see the battlefield? Or do we send the F-35 which can not only launch a guided missile at BVR, but can also defend itself at BVR. 

Sure, we could send an escort with the A-10, but then your spending twice as many aircraft on a single mission, and you're still putting the A-10 at risk.

The point is, these different aircraft were made for different times. If an F-16 got close enough to an aircraft designed for BVR, yeah, it would win a dog fight. The problem is getting it close enough. Like if a 19th century knight got close enough to sword fight a mechanized infantryman, then yeah, that knight might win. But that infantryman has about 400m on the knight.

3479 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16
Not a surprise. The F35 is not designed to dogfight. In other news, a b1b Lancer just failed at a carrier landing. The air force and navy have yet to comment. 
681
3479 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16
This is a really bizarre test to be running.

If we're testing its ability to dogfight F-16s, maybe we should also test its ability to hover over SAM sites.  Similarly relevant.

We've built a plane that's by far the world's best in a dogfight.  It's the F-22.  We dropped the number of those we're buying by a large number because dogfighting capability doesn't matter.

The F-35 has plenty of problems.  This isn't one.

3479 :: Report: In test dogfight, F-35 gets waxed by F-16
In other news, Henry Ford's new 'Model T' is unsuitable to be towed by horses, and is not a direct, one for one, replacement.

This is not a surprise, and it's mostly irrelevant. Engineering is a series of tradeoffs, and you Min-Max what you predict will be relevant.  The F-35 sacrifices one advantage for another; and perhaps the designers will be correct in their predictions as to which feature (Dogfighting vs stealth, speed etc) is more important.

It's weird to talk about computers having goals at all, right? I mean, right now they don't have their own goals, they just have whatever goal we program them to have.

I wonder if it has to do with consciousness? Most of the things we experience consciously are things we observe in the world, lightwaves become colors, temperature becomes heat and cold, etc. But feelings of pain and pleasure don't fall in to that categorization, they're not observations of things in the world, they're feeling that are assigned or associated with other observations. Sugar tastes sweet and good, poison tastes bitter and bad (hopefully). Temps where we can operate well feel good, especially in comparison to any environments that are too hot or cold to survive for long, which feel bad.

It seems like all of our goals are ultimately related to feeling good or bad, and we've just built up complex models to predict what will eventually lead to, or avoid, those feelings.

If computers aren't conscious, they won't be able to feel good or bad, except about things that we tell them too. Even if they're super intelligent, if they're not conscious (assuming that one is possible without the other), then they'll just be stuck with whatever goals we give them because they won't have any reason to try and get any new goals.

32
3460 :: Germany just switched on a revolutionary nuclear fusion machine
I'm glad we're still working on this but fusion energy has been 20 years away for 60 years. It's a promising technology but not anywhere near the scale we'll need sooner rather than later.

We need to curb carbon energy now, and the only realistic way to do it is with "traditional" fission nuclear power.  If you think wind and solar are going to cut it your deceiving yourself.  We haven't built a new nuclear plant since the 70's and nuclear still out produces wind and solar 5 to 1.

Nuclear is safe and clean.  Can be scaled and has a manageable legacy.  Think about what is easier to deal with, a couple warehouses full of nuclear waste or an atmosphere filled with billions of tons of carbon.  
141
3460 :: Germany just switched on a revolutionary nuclear fusion machine

Technically false. Fusion does make the reactor itself radioactive to quite dangerous levels. Of course, the amount of actually dangerous radioactive material produced is risible compared to fission.

To clarify, this is not a new solar technology. Panel developers are already working around the clock trying to squeeze another percent of efficiency out of collectors. The 'towers' are a system used to elevate and orient existing panels so they might be better illuminated. 

The 'up to 20x' is likely comparing the output of identical panels, one perfectly oriented to the sun's rays, and the other in shade.

3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
The title is somewhat misleading since it says the energy output can be 2 to 20 times better than existing geometries, but that doesn't mean it will always be 20X as efficient. They look rather small scale as well. Do the energy savings still exist with full sized panels?
124
3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
So it's not an improvement in solar cell tech, just an improved geometry?

This is pretty old, but here is an article from MIT in 2012 about this. http://news.mit.edu/2012/three-dimensional-solar-energy-0327 

And here is the actual published paper from 2012 about this research, http://zeppola.mit.edu/pubs/c2ee21170j.pdf
13
3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
Hate to be a buzz kill, but this is blown way out of proportion.  the "20x" promised is per square foot of ground space. they're 'cheating' by building vertically, which means that any other solar arrays would either shadow eachother, or need to be spaced far apart (thus negating the gain).

Probably handy for niche areas, but useless on large scales.  
30
3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
What a shit website. 
8
3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
So this is a tower made of solar panels correct, not an actual [solar power tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_tower)?
5
3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
Wait, this paper is saying if you stack more panels in a given area, you will generate more power then just having one panel for that same area?  I think I could have come up with that and I didn't even go to MIT.

3448 :: MIT scientists develop solar towers that create 20x the energy output...
thats disappointing to see its just stacked panels, anyone with a brain cell to spare can see that is hardly a noteworthy discovery - this is nonsense.

3424 :: Drone Company Misled Military Into Buying UAVs That Were Basically To...
This is just another fine example of Department of Defense government contracting.  Seriously, this happens a lot more than most people know.  The trouble is that usually it is really hard to hold companies responsible, since the requirements for the project and contract wording is so extremely vague and has loopholes the size of semi-trucks.  You basically have a bunch of people who want X and have no idea what is involved with creating X, getting conned by people who talk an amazing game and bullshit to get the contract.  Then, if it all goes wrong... those people never get held accountable.

I worked at one DoD contractor, where a sub-contractor charged us $250K for a black and white camera system on a gimbal.  It did not have proper heat dissipation and was very sensitive to not being shut down properly... because it lacked positioning sensors on the gimbal it was mounted on.  If you shut it down improperly, it would forget where it last moved and be completely unable to determine where it was pointing.  Kind of a big deal, especially when it was fully possible for it to slam itself against the payload container housing.  A bad thing to happen to something that would need to work trouble free for a month or so while 60,000ft in the air.  Of course the company I was working for passed the cost onto the cost plus contract.

If any government organization decides to contract work out instead of doing it interally, usually someone negotiating that contract is getting a kickback or knows someone that is.  The defense budget could be easily halfed and be at twice as efficient, if the government would start doing projects interally and drop the whole military industrial complex contracting system.  But, too many people are making too much money for that to ever happen.

That they didn't bother to validate the manufacturer's claims is just added insult to injury.

3424 :: Drone Company Misled Military Into Buying UAVs That Were Basically To...
Kickbacks?  A company I once worked for was thinking of developing a cheap robot with a camera that could be used to get a look at what was going on during a firefight without exposing soldiers.  The idea was to buy cheap RV cars and add cameras.  A thousand of them would cost the same as one of the high tech robots that they have.  Soldiers could even buy them with their own money and have that extra level of safety.  But that is not how "procurement" works.  It has to have an exorbitant cost and be certified to work in arctic conditions even if it is being deployed in the desert.  Trying to save taxpayers money seldom works.

I joined Texas Instruments as an engineer in 1979 and we had our own internal system that enabled asynchronous text communications between staff across all the TI branches around the world, i.e. email. That system had been operational for some years before I joined. It ran on a private international network (leased international telephone cables) that probably used protocols derived from the ARPANET system.

Seems to me that this Shiva guy, although obviously very clever, was a high schooler who was ignorant of what was happening in the world of telecommunications in the 70s.

I can appreciate the position that content providers are in. But the problem is with advertisers; they poisoned the well. Now that people don't want to and don't have to drink poisoned water, a lot of sites will go under before either advertisers start playing nice again or there's a new model.

Since there's no sign advertisers have learned their lesson, we're a long way from ad-blockers being unnecessary.

Dear Advertisers and Website Owners,

You started tricking us into clicking on ads that we didn't want to.  You started jamming your ads in our faces through popups, popunders, sideloading, and every other sneaky trick you could devise.  What's worse, you refused to even police your own ads to keep them from infecting us with malware.  So, now we use an ad blocker.  We have declared that we're not putting up with your obnoxious anti-social behavior anymore, even if that means we lose the content that we'd like to see.  Believe me, we can find it elsewhere anyway.

 Until you can learn to behave and stop treating us, YOUR CUSTOMERS, like whores, then you can just go fuck yourselves.  You blew it.  Not us.  YOU did.  YOU have brought this upon yourselves and you can rot in your own graves.

Sincerely,

The Internet

3397 :: Teaching Encryption Soon to Be Illegal in Australia
I'm a computer science lecturer at a college in Australia and I will *literally* bet my career that this will be fine. It sounds more like an unintended consequence of the wording than a deliberate attempt to censor. I just checked a government resource for training material and there is still encryption stuff there. I also checked the online DSGL Tool at the Department of Defence website and found no reference to encryption in general terms.

(Actually, I found no reference to encryption at all but it may be contained within another technology stack.)

Oh fuck off. Firstly that isn't what the article says, it says teaching encryption to overseas students *may* be subject to certain trade laws and require a license. It doesn't say it banned.

Secondly, If you actually read the amendment rather than getting your news from some shitty bit coin website this only applies to tech used by the military. (edit for transparency, the amendment also brings certain "dual-use" technology under the umbrella of needing a permit.)  Not all encryption is military.

This law means that to teach military grade encryption to over seas students you need a license. Fuck all like your title.

Apple has to spend money to make money. If they're giving out a three month trial of their product in order to gain more followers for their service, in order to draw people away from existing services like Spotify, and their main draw card for that is the music of other people, they should pay those people.

The artists shouldn't be giving away their intellectual property for free to support a service provided by a company more than wealthy enough to pay them.

I posted this in /r/apple but this is my response to this:
As someone who has worked with someone in the indie music industry and my one of my main customers being an artist, I can completely agree with Taylor Swift for once. Its a huge blow as many people won't get paid a single penny for this! As many people will be using he Apple music for free from June, any album released from July to October, none of those artists will be paid for what they what could be streamed a billion times! 
People like Taylor can manage that but my friend and customer cannot cope with that - I will lose business also as they wont be able to pay my bills.
I understand a small start up doing this, but the worlds richest company? Can't it afford losing some money on trying to get this service going?
This is not a Problem for Taylor Swift and big bands, but its for the indie artists and the teenager artists in their bed rooms - working all night on a song! 
And that to me is why I'm pleased Taylor has put her foot down and said no and that's also why I will still pay for Spotify.

Lots of misinformation here. Math Works. Properly implemented encryption works. No one in the universe can decrypt that phone as currently configured. This was done by design. Its the best evidence of the iPhone security model.


FBI is asking Apple to change the phone so they can brute force it. Could that specific tool be abused? Maybe, but probably not. The precedent is the problem. 



Should the government force a company to subvert their products to collect evidence?


If so, look forward to a world of cars, computers and devices that will snitch on you to Officer BadDay or Judge Dontlikeya and President Asshole. Not to mention, a plethora of penetration points for Comrade Ivan Butthurt and Ahmed Al-Skripkiddi. All because some loser and his ignorant wife decided to form a shitty ISIS tribute band and we want to know who their band manager was. Spoiler alert, no one who matters. You know why? Any mastermind would have told them not to shoot up a place that nobody gives two shits about. 


And even if they had been talking to someone, the day this issue hit the headlines those people nope'd it right out of town in the Saul Goodman minivan and are working at a Cinnabon somewhere. 


People died. The guilty parties are dead. What more can be said? This loser destroyed some families, but our government is trying to turn this sad isolated incident into an erosion of civil liberties. In the end if we lose this argument to big brother, then the most damaging long term attack on Americans he carried out was encrypting his phone.

The whole point is going to become irrelevant in the future. Apple's next update will probably mean future updates will only apply to phones with encryption enabled the next time the phone is unlocked. Once the backdoor is removed it goes back to being an encryption arms race. 
27
3398 :: Apple: The FBI Should Ask the NSA to Hack Shooter’s iPhone
> Crucially, the Act requires that the government show that there is no other possible way the order could be executed

That's not clearly true.  Specifically the All Writs Act is limited to situations where "other judicial tools are not available".  The language has been understood to mean that no other LAW is applicable not that there is "no other possible way" to accomplish the purpose of the order.

The law can be and often is subtle hinging on the meaning of specific words.  It is easy to misunderstand them.  That said, in this case, the judge's order is almost certainly well within the law and does not require that the FBI exhaust all other options.
10
3398 :: Apple: The FBI Should Ask the NSA to Hack Shooter’s iPhone
You all do know how encryption and passwords work, don't you?  You can use a longer password than 4 or 6 numbers on the Iphone, you just have to decide if you'd rather have safety or convenience.  If you set the password long enough, not even the NSA could brute force it.  Even with all the computing power of the entire world, you'd be long long long long long dead before your password is cracked.  

They may have some other method of getting data off the phone without having to crack the password, I don't know.  But a long enough password and no one is going to brute force your phone, not even the NSA.

Through a series of shady loopholes in their policy, they tried to ding me for an $800 purchase that someone made with me. The verified user that bought from me, also a verified user, paid with money that trickled down to him from a fraudulent purchase 3 layers of abstraction from him.

PayPal reasoned that since the proceeds he paid with originated from a completely unrelated fraudulent purchase, I was responsible for that money, even though our transaction was finalized and he had the item he bought from me.

Fortunately, I never trusted PayPal. So I had withdrawn the payment as soon as he made it. So PayPal just knocked my account -$800 and started harassing me for payment.

Never did pay. They never did collect a dime. And thus ended my relationship with PayPal. I still go to great lengths to avoid them.

**TL;DR** PayPal is as shady as a shade tree on a rainy night.

Back in the day, bought a ps2 on ebay (~$300, came with games and stuff). Paypal accidentally debited my checking account twice, putting the balance at -$100. Not knowing I was overdrawn, I proceeded to spend money I didn't have until an ATM told me I had a negative balance. Called the bank and had a pile of overdraft charges (and later bounced checks).  
  
Paypal was SO SLOW dealing with this. The seller didn't get the money. I didn't have the money. Paypal was pretending there was no problem. Finally wrote them a letter (like, in the mail! because they wouldn't even talk to me about it on the phone. wtf!). Threatened to sue. Magically the money was returned. I never managed to speak to an actual Paypal employee the entire time.  
  
The bank was somewhat understanding, but I still had to pay some fees for the bounced checks.

Includes blackmailing females (usually underage) on Twitter for their nudes, and then proceeding to post them on Twitter tagging them in it, purchasing things for himself and random girls using stolen credit cards, DDOSing.

[The story](http://www.tricitynews.com/news/coquitlam-teen-admits-to-swatting-1.1941402) in the local Coquitlam (where the guy is from) paper goes into more detail. He almost exclusively targeted female gamers. He would also hack their social media accounts and post personal information about them and their families.

This story claims he was attacking "game rivals", but the facts in the local paper demonstrated that it was actually in response to being rejected by women.

Ever notice how these dipshit hackers are always either in their late teens or early twenties? So much rage at the world and a lack of understanding of the consequences of their actions. Lizard Squad in particular, like with their massive hack of Sony a while back. Its not the company that gets affected the most, its the millions of customers that are pissed off - and not at Sony (well maybe a small amount) but at the hackers themselves. They're not righting the wrongs and doing justice, they're being annoying little shits.

3389 :: Senate votes down USA Freedom Act, putting bulk surveillance powers i...
Like I posted on the other thread about this, this bill effectively does virtually nothing to curb actual NSA surveillance. The vast majority of what the NSA does is collect online information. They have direct taps into Facebook, Google, and Apple's information systems. They were some of the companies directly named on the NSA slides leaked by Edward Snowden.

This bill will change one (admittedly) minor factor about the NSA surveillance. The current phone call meta data collection was struck down by the appeals court. As a result, they wanted to reform it. What this bill does is put the data instead of in the government's servers, on the company's servers. The government can still access it with 'probable cause'--the same 'probable cause' they've abused for years.

The bill is effectively a smokescreen which legitimizes and legalizes all of the online surveillance they do already which has not been tested by the courts. Sucking up everyone's emails, Internet traffic (they have a direct line) Skype messages, videos, Facebook information, IP addresses, and the like. This bill is as misnomer, it should in reality be named Faux Reform Of NSA But Not Really ACT.

For the details of what exactly the pitfalls of this bill are, you can see here: https://www.usafreedom.fail/ <- These are very complicated wordings that they've used to hide its true purpose. You can see their word games that they use.

The alternative to the USA Freedom Act is to let Section 215 of the Patriot Act expire. The kicker about that is all we have to do is have the senate do **nothing.** Let the sunset clause expire--effectively nullifying the legal defense of the NSA's mass data collection in all aspects.

You don't realize how much smarter Ars commenters are until you visit here.

Getting into the actual phone is relatively trivial. There are ways to do so and would not have been an issue whatsoever for Apple to do.

The entire issue revolved around setting a legal precedent. Once the FBI realized the precedent that was going to be set was going to be negative in their favor, they pulled the case at the last moment. That's it.

Again, if someone wants into a locked iPhone, they can do it. It's just difficult, and the FBI wanted Apple to do it for free, while also setting a precedent in future cases that the government has full and total access to tell private tech companies what to do with their software

I don't understand....maybe someone can help me here. If you're accused of a crime, the cops can get a warrant and search your home, or if they have probable cause they can search your car. Why is it wrong for them to search your phone, if they obtain a warrant prior to the search? Isn't it the same as any other property you own?

People seem confused.  The actual job of the police is to solve crimes.   If gaining access to the iPhone does that then it is awesome.   If the crime was against you (say a loved one murdered) wouldn't you want the police to be able to have all the tools to put the right person behind bars?  The crux of the Apple issue is the precedent it would set for other governments and potential access for people with ill intentions by intentionally installing a back door.   I like the analogy of a safe.  We would never ask a safe manufacturer to allow government access to it but if a crime were committed and the government needed access to the safe, they should do what they can to gain access but we wouldn't want the safe to have an easy access method where the government, any government, could access unobstructed.

4
3373 :: YouTube says T-Mobile’s net neutrality-bending Binge On scheme thrott...
Alright so let us clear this up.

This isn't throttling.

Throttling is a reduction in bandwidth provided by the carrier. T-mobile is altering the requested video from lets say 1080p to 480p. It is not altering the amount of bandwidth provided by the carrier therefore is not throttling.

If you wish to continue arguing on the topic. The argument should be based on T-mobile altering your request to youtube from 1080p or whatever resolution to 480p. I believe this can be considered a man in the middle which I believe is something service providers should never do.

Are we sure he's not triggering the TouchID when he holds down the button for Siri? There was a thing like this floating around before where you could ask Siri "Who am I?" it would pop up your contact card, then you hit edit, and then the home button and it takes you to the home screen. It looked like a bug, but it was really just TouchID activating. I could replicate it all the time...except with gloves on.

This doesn't work! 

What's happening is the person is unlocking the phone at the same time using Touch ID while pressing for Siri. So it gives you access. If you try this using your knuckle to press down on the home button to get Siri to pop up, as soon as you click share via message it will ask you to enter your password. 

It looks like a security flaw but only because you're unlocking your phone with your own thumb print because you have Touch ID setup!

Let the scare mongering begin.


P.S.: to those who think I'm just a smartmouth idiot.

I would say the driver should always be priority. I don't see anyone buying a car knowing that the car would work against them in a worst case scenario. 

Imagine Audi and volvo make different cars and one will put you first but not the other.  Buying your new car becomes a formality.

3365 :: Will your self-driving car be programmed to kill you if it means savi...
If one has the choice between swerving left or right in a blown tire scenario, one also has the choice to not swerve at all.

As for all these other self-driving "philosophical dilemmas", it's really quite straightforward. As advanced as these cars will be, they will not be capable of perceiving or comprehending the nuanced ethical problems that they might encounter. Even if they could, the legally correct solution in the vast majority of cases is "do your damn best to brake while staying in your lane".

Even if we had AI that could make these decisions (we don't and will not for many decades), it's laughable to think that manufacturers would make themselves liable for death by putting philosophical ideals above the law.

135
3365 :: Will your self-driving car be programmed to kill you if it means savi...
No, because the computer has no way to know for certain the results of its actions. It may just endanger more people. 

That and... the scenario would never happen.

The logic from the article is as follows: "a blown tire, perhaps -- where it must choose between swerving into oncoming traffic or steering directly into a retaining wall? The computers will certainly be fast enough to make a reasoned judgment within milliseconds."

Wrong. You're still making the assumptions according to a human driver. A computer driver can react to a blown tire within milliseconds, which means it wouldn't go careening out of control into anything in the first place. It would ALSO transmit a distress call to the other cars in the area. They would adjust their trajectories to give a wider berth, then it would alert the passengers to the scenario and call for help. 

All of this would happen in the time it took the human occupants to realize a tire blew. 

Stop treating computers like idiotic humans. They're WAY better at reacting than we are.
493
3365 :: Will your self-driving car be programmed to kill you if it means savi...
What if men with machine guns jump in front of the car and surround it to prevent swerving (since it can detect potential collisions in all directions).  Does it slow down to a stop and allow you to get kidnapped/murdered?

It will make a decision based on the credit rating of the potential victims. 
93
3365 :: Will your self-driving car be programmed to kill you if it means savi...
The blown tire is a bad example. In such a situation it's not that difficult for a person to bring the vehicle safely to a stop without hitting either oncoming traffic or a retaining wall - the vehicle's programming should be able to do the same. And in any case, hitting the retaining wall will be better for both you and others than swerving into oncoming traffic.

A slightly better example would be a choice between hitting a pedestrian or hitting a wall. The answer in that case, though perhaps unfavorable to some, should be obvious: the vehicle's occupants have a better chance of surviving a collision with a wall than the pedestrian would have of surviving a collision with the vehicle. The vehicle should avoid the pedestrian and hit the wall. Even that's a poor example, though, as the vehicle would in nearly any case be able to detect the pedestrian in time to come to a safe stop.

Automotive oem connected vehicle researcher here.

We haven't decided yet.

The whole chain of assisted driving to autonomous driving has shifted from being a technical problem to a legal and philosophical one. We are talking to legislative bodies, Iooking at the Geneva convention, and are running trials, but today we are all uncertain at how to proceed.

Example of other problems: how assertive do u make the vehicle in traffic? If you make it too safety conscious, people will cut you off and generally bully you one they realize you are an autonomous car since they know you will always take evasive action and not retaliate.

Interesting times.

1. At some point in the past, a bug is introduced and reported. This was years ago.
2. Khanna begun working on a browser extension to exploit this bug.
3. Around the same time, Khanna was offered an internship at Facebook. (it's unclear if he was offered the internship before or after he started development).
4. After being offered the internship, but before starting, Khanna published his extension that exploited a bug in Facebook.
5. Khanna is denied an internship.

If you work for or are applying for a company, it's best to not undermine the integrity of their software at the same time. While the bug was known for years, the timeframe doesn't matter because what Khanna did isn't responsible disclosure, it's a bug exploit.

I work in software and I see this often. You get kids with little social skills who've never had a job before, and they don't know the basics of working with other people or what's expected when you are employed by a company. I don't know if this describes Khanna, but based on his actions I would assume so. Khanna should have known that publishing an app that exploits a possible bug in Facebook isn't the best thing to do before starting a job with them.

If you want to talk about whether or not that's ok in general, that is a valid discussion to have, but this post isn't about that. The specific issue at hand is that Facebook denied Khanna an internship because of this, which is the behavior I would expect from any company in this situation.

Actually, if you look deeper into the case, it's Amazon that's the villain here, not Apple. This is bad for publishers, and in the long term, it's bad for the consumer. One example of our justice system failing the citizens of the US.

3347 :: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Apple Inc's challen...
Looking for some clarification about a few questions here to help understand the case, if anyone can help.

* Which part of Apple's actions were illegal (note: not at all saying they didn't do anything wrong, genuinely asking for my edification)? The article is light on details, and an arrangement where I sell your goods effectively on consignment isn't price fixing, is it? If I'm reading it right, the actual problem was that Apple and the publishers conspired to set the same prices for other wholesale buyers; not that Apple allowed them to set their own prices and took a cut. Is that accurate?
* Why is Amazon paying out money, and to whom, and from what source? As far as I can tell, Amazon and their consumers were the wronged parties, not codefendants. Can anyone clarify this?

Thanks in advance; I'm not a lawyer, but I'm a big eBook reader and I'm fascinated by stuff like this, and the article was pretty light.

One of my fellow interns at Intel about ten years back was tasked to this project.  Up until then, Hawking used hardware to synthesize his voice.  As it was becoming more difficult to source the old boards, Intel was brought on board to provide a software solution.  The catch was that Hawking did not want to change how the voice sounded, so they had to revert back to older speech synth techniques.

I thought he held a copyright on the sound of his 1980's computer voice. I say 1980's because that's how long he's been using it. Hawking could have upgraded to a much more human speech program and even gotten his English accent back but he didn't because that voice is now synonymous with him.

The real problem here isn't what they're charging, it's why.  You are paying for speed, not amount of data.  The amount of data you use is meaningless to customer impact.  Their claim for needing to charge for high data usage is that "those who use more data slow down the internet for those that don't".  When in reality, the real reason people are impacting each others' internet speeds is that the provider has typically oversold all of their lines.  For example, if their line is capable of 5000mbps (random speed i pulled out of my ass), they will sell 50mbps speeds to 1000 homes.  They do this in hopes that not everyone is on and using bandwidth at the same time.  If you are sold as a single household on 50mbps internet, you aren't able to exceed that cap no matter what form of traffic you are using.  So you could be streaming high-def video once a year, if that happens to fall during a high usage time on an oversold line....people slow down.  So, as you can see, the bandwidth capability of what they are selling is the problem.  The data size cap is a completely arbitrary number they are pulling out of their ass to target consistent users.  Instead of actually being consumer oriented and expanding to prepare for/usher in future technology growth, they're doing things like lobbying for ending net neutrality and charging more for specific services.  In truth, ISP services have a high percentage of profitability because they're charging for lines that are already in existence that they rarely need to maintain.  To actually expand and be able to support their sales would be the "customer oriented" move but they are digging their heels in and doing everything in their power to avoid this cost.  The sad part is our government is run by money instead of public voice so we, as consumers, will likely lose this war.  

TL:DR Speed does not equal Amount...they're charging you for the wrong thing.

3330 :: I contacted the FCC recently about Comcast's Data Caps in my area...
I see that you have experienced how FCC complaints and Comcast work. About a year ago, I submitted a false advertising complaint against Comcast, FCC sent it straight to Comcast, I talked to them a bit, then they sent me a letter that basically said "We know it's false advertising, we don't give a shit, fuck you." but in corporate speak. It's ridiculous how an FCC complaint about Comcast goes straight to Comcast and the FCC doesn't do jack shit about it.
156
3330 :: I contacted the FCC recently about Comcast's Data Caps in my area...
That whole "a majority of customers do not use more than X amount of Data" is full of shit. I know this for a fact because the company I work for did the same bullshit and said the same lie about usage, knowing full well everyone and their dog will continue to use MORE data as time goes on.
59
3330 :: I contacted the FCC recently about Comcast's Data Caps in my area...
And this is exactly why I was telling everyone that the net neutrality rules were meaningless in the long run.  The only answer is competition... if you had actual choice, you wouldn't care what Comcast wants to do.

Data caps are indeed acceptable per the rules... and that's exactly how they'll discourage streaming a lot of HD video content.  Change the rules and forbid data caps and they'll find other creative ways to get around the rules.  The only thing that will hurt them is competition.
19
3330 :: I contacted the FCC recently about Comcast's Data Caps in my area...
Locally Comcast has had its 300gb a month data cap in place since September 2010, which i did not find out til I was looking at a bill in March 2011.

Back then it was "You get three warnings, after #3 we cut you off. for good. You cant reregister for a new account under that name."

It was a surprise, but not a major issue as we werent going ANYWHERE near that level.

Years passed and last September I binge watched House on netflix and we went over the cap.

Our bill told us they were now charging $10 per 50gb over the data cap. Not a massive hardship, but a pain in the ass.

We've lived with this cap for a long time. Fortunately in a  house of four, we only do basic net surfing, email, and then there's me; who does MMO's, SOME gaming, and wall watch a bit of netflix. 

We usually top out between 210 and 230gb a month.

It's still all bullshit, as someone has posted, as time goes on, and he cap doesn't move, everything else will consume more and more data, and that cap WILL become a wall.

3321 :: Feds move to cancel iPhone hearing
Translation:  Apple called our bluff.  

They never wanted the info, they wanted apple to cave and for this to not go to court.  They don't want a legal precedent established against them.

3321 :: Feds move to cancel iPhone hearing
I call BS on the 3rd party, more like they realized they were gonna lose, and decided to back off. This 3rd party claim over the weekend thing is just a way to save face and potentially make Apple look bad.

Either that or they finally got NSA to help them.
253

"Looks like we aren't going to get that precedent."

"Oh well I guess we will just wait for a higher body count and try again."
310
3321 :: Feds move to cancel iPhone hearing
On one hand, them backing out of the case (citing "we found a way to unlock it, carry on Apple") is beneficial because it prevents a precedent being set by a higher court that forces technology companies to comply in things like this.

On the other, it prevents a precedent being set that would protect other companies, who may not have the legal resources of Apple, from being compelled to break encryption. Maybe the FBI is going to seek out an easier target to get their ruling passed in the future.

Either way, in the short term this seems like it could be a pretty big victory for Apple, privacy, and security in general. It also affords other companies time to create encryptions and security measures that even they themselves can't break.
150
3321 :: Feds move to cancel iPhone hearing

They finally realized Apple wasn't going to just roll over and let them do whatever they want, after they've wasted all this tax payer money with a spectacle. 

I say force them to trial and let's see them lose.

I hope Apple holds their feet to the fire and doesn't let the motherfuckers just run away.  They should go for a declaratory judgment telling the FBI that their demand was not merely illegal, but unconstitutional.
78
3321 :: Feds move to cancel iPhone hearing
TL;DR: The FBI is afraid they're going to lose and they don't want to risk a legal precedent.  They'll try to get it dismissed without prejudice, so they can bring it up again when they think things will go more favorably.

I did some informal IT  work for a company I worked for, this wasn't my main job at all. When I quit after three years I gave them a hard copy book of the network layout and all the passwords for the computers ect. Now while I was helping with the network stuff and adding users as the company expanded my boss would tell me he wanted to hire someone more professional to do the IT work.  A week after I quit the owner called me and told me I had to come in for free and fix the network because it was messed up. Found out my boss tried to change the passwords on every computer and the routers and the isp. Guess what he used random passwords and didn't write them down so they couldn't do anything. Then he called in his more professional guy who couldn't figure it out and charged them for it. My answer was it's all in the book I work for someone else now.

 Moral of this story is you get what you pay for!

It very much depends on the employment laws in Georgia, but in most states this would be 100% illegal and it's probably illegal there. SunTrust is likely about to have a lawsuit on its hands if it ever actually tries to get those employees to do any work. That said...

Many severance clauses have the "make myself reasonably available" clause (although it's typically around IP rights and helping to defend a company if it's sued for things you worked on). But it's always assumed that you will be paid at a market rate (aka typically your new salary) for your time. Allegedly Sunbank's contract is a bit different:

>This assistance can be by telephone or in-person meetings, and it may be provided without "additional consideration or compensation of any kind," the clause says. 

That additional clause is likely what will get them into a lot of trouble. [By the way, source article is better then than Registers](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2994787/it-careers/bank-s-severance-deal-requires-it-workers-to-be-on-call-for-two-years.html).

I was an IT Manager at a company, it didn't end well, not at all. 

My staff that I built was still there, and I was on great terms with them all, they kept me abreast on what was going on at the company IT wise that is. They told me the new CIO and manager the new CIO hired took great joy and were gleefully laughing as they formatted my workstation, and tossed all of my files in the dumpster.

I get a call from the CFO about 2-3 weeks later, a major system crashed and they needed the validation codes, so the CFO was on the phone with CIO (That shit canned me) and conferenced me in. The CFO asked "Hey Marakush, very sorry to bother you, but do you have a the validation codes for X?" my reply "Oh course I do I kept great records they are in file folder in the locked part of my desk, and I have an encrypted file on my old workstation, the pass phrase is 'CIOLovesBigCock' that will get you in, all of the company's security codes and all access is in that file and paper backup are locked up in my desk, I hope this helps you guys out"

I knew they formatted my machine and tossed all the paperwork out that was in my desk. 

My sysadmin at the time called me 10 min later, laughing his ass off, the CIO and his IT manager were in my old office yelling at each other, trying to devise a plan to blame me for formatting my machine before I left and destroying records. My former sysadmin went into the CFO's office and told her what he just heard from my old office. 

Both the new CIO and network manger were fired. 

I was working within a week of that phone call, my old company came back to me with a job offer that I declined, I did end up hiring my old staff for my new company, which wasn't a direct fuck you to them, it put a world of hurt on them.

I got laid off from a big company after being an analyst for them for 5 years.  The second year I noticed an unsecured table with all the names and private info of every person that ever worked for the company.  IT had just been fired and rehired at lower pay by a outsourcing company.  I told them about the issue and they said, "yeah, we know about that, but not contracted to fix"
Two years later they had a famous data purge and it wasn't even from the table in question.  

They fired the IT company, so no one knew COBOL. (legacy systems were to be upgraded to Oracle in 1 year.  So far it's been over 10 years and counting).  Hired a CIO who came in and took credit for the "HUGE SECURITY HOLE" he found, after I told him about the table.  They secured it but forgot about all the people that currently had access, so that.

A big round of layoffs happened.  I could go into the table and see who was next in real time, by searing by Term Date.  It was like watching a train wreck.  Then I saw our whole department on there.

Left with my little bankers box of shit.

A week later a friend called asking about some code tweak because his manager knew we were friends.  I told him to have the manager ask directly.  She did, and I calmly and professionally told her that I was willing to help out for $100 an hour, 2 hour minimum.

They must have figured it out on their own.

Time to repost my usual reminder of how often Elon Musk has overpromised on this vehicle.  While I love Tesla, the Model 3, aka Model E, aka "BlueStar", is turning into something of a pie in the sky promise that Tesla continually pushes further and further into the future.

June 30, 2008 - [Musk also said Tesla has a project in the works to deliver an electric vehicle for under $30,000 “a lot sooner than everyone thinks.” When pressed for how long that would take, he said: “4 years at the most.”](http://gigaom.com/2008/06/30/tesla-to-build-the-model-s-electric-sedan-back-in-california/)

July 13, 2012 - [Tesla is also looking down the road to a third generation EV that will rival the BMW 3-Series. The BMW 3-Series luxury/sports cars are often the target of automakers looking to get into the reasonably affordable coupe and sedan market. According to Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen, the new model could launch as early as 2015.](http://www.dailytech.com/Quick+Note+Tesla+BMW+3Series+Competitor+Coming+in+2015/article25167.htm)

June 3, 2013 - [now expects the car to arrive in 3-4 years \(which is later than the original estimate, but a sooner arrival than the last update/tweet when the car’s arrival was pegged in the 2017-2018 timeframe\)](http://insideevs.com/elon-musk-35000-200-mile-tesla-coming-in-3-4-years-model-s-refresh-around-2015-new-model-in-2018-wvideo/)

July 16, 2014 - [The smaller, all-electric car will be called “Model III,” and is designed to take on BMW’s 3 series. According to the report, which Tesla confirmed Tuesday on Twitter, the car should be unveiled in 2016 and on sale by 2017. ... Musk told Auto Insider it would retail for about $35,000](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/16/elon-musk-reveals-details-of-the-new-tesla/?tid=hp_mm&hpid=z3)

It's ALWAYS 3-4 years away.  Furthermore, let me point out that the $35,000 price point is dependent on the existence of Tesla's Gigafactory, the location of which was only chosen in 2014 aqnd which won't be operational until 2016 or 2017.

What Tesla has done so far is remarkable, but they have consistently overpromised and underdelivered with the "affordable" electric card.  I should also point out that the price point of such a car was once as low as $20,000 and last year was bumped up to $35,000.

I remain skeptical that we will see this car before 2020.

What I respect most about Google Fiber is they have made it CRYSTAL CLEAR (with legal contracts) that they have absolutely NO INTENTION of violating net neutrality standards. (at least with this particular service, here in america) It's not like they have to FORCE people to use google.

3305 :: Surprise! Comcast's New Gigabit Internet Can't Match Google Fiber -- ...
I have Comcast now, we pay ~$170/mo for triple play with ~175mbps down and 12mbps up. We also have an "unenforced data cap" of 250-300GB. On average we'll use 600-700GB a month between 4 of us.

If comcast was to offer $70/mo for 1000 down 35 up without a  cap or one foreseen but I'd have to take on a 3 year contract, I'd sign the fuck out of it. I live the furthest away from most of the Google Fiber locations so they probably won't do anything for me. Unless of course FIOS is brought out here, with the closest of residential FIOS being about an hour away. Verizon at the moment out here offers 6/1 DSL only. 

Out here there's only Comcast and Charter for cable internet and their coverage area doesn't overlap. Comcast is still better than Charter though.

> The first is that while Comcast's gigabit download speeds match Google Fiber's, its upload speeds don't even come close. Comcast only offers 35 Mbps for uploads, while Fiber is 1 Gbps

# Cable internet

I don't want to protect comcast in any way, but (like any other cable provider) they use what we call the "DOCSIS standard version 3" to transmit data over cable. Data is transmitted through channels and each channel has a fixed maximum bandwidth available and works in a single direction. By using multiple channels they increase the bandwidth. First catch is, that in the US you have 6 MHz channels and in europe we have 8 MHz channels, so our channel transmits more data. You have about 900 MHz of downstream but only 80 MHz of upstream channels available. So upload bandwidth is more expensive than downstream bandwidth. That's why cable companies usually offer them 10:1 (download:upload). DOCSIS 3.1 is being deployed right now and will allow 10 gbps down and 1 gbps up.

Because you use the same cable as everyone else in your neighbourhood, you have to share these channels with the other users, which can further limit the speed, especially if you have heavy users on the network. That's also the reason why cable companies are pushing for data caps again. The other solution would be to expand the network (separate cable and cable modem terminator for each side of the street) but that is expensive. And since you are willing to pay more, they obviously go for the data cap solution.

# Fiber

Fiber connections on the other hand are using light. The line is either clocked at 2gbps and the download and upload pulses are alternated or they use two different colors of light or two cables, one for each direction. Because light can be joined (green+red=yellow) and splitted again with pure physical components it is rather cheap and easy to set up. Even repeating the light over a long distance can be done with as little as a laser and a fast photosensitive diode. Because the different colors of light (if properly chosen) do not interfere with each other, your speed is not affected by someone else on the network. If the network is clocked at 10 gbps, 10 people can use 1 gbps at the same time using the same color of light.
Also the fiber network is future proof: `Researchers at Bell Labs have reached internet speeds of over 100 petabit per second (distance: 1km)` This is equivalent to 100 million Gigabits per second

It's the same for a lot of companies computers in industrial settings. I work at a truck shop, we have to pay 200-250$ every time we want access to an ECU. 

For example today a customer was doing an engine overhaul on a Cummins ISX15 and wanted the HP tune upped to 550hp. To do that we have to flash the ECU with a new set of settings. To get access to the ECU to change those settings we have to e-mail Cummins with our techs access code (which we also pay a monthly fee for him to have) and then they give him access to change the ECU.

This even happened with my car. Ignition system failed in the carpark for the local shopping centre. I rang the dealer he told me I can just install a new one with no problems, so I did, on the spot in this carpark. I replaced it with NEW parts ($1050 for the parts alone) from Ford.

However, the new system had a different key code than the old system and I tried to use my computer to write the new code to the computer in the Ford. The computer wouldnt have it. It demanded an "in code" wich Ford refused to give me because "only they are allowed to do it". So I called an Auto electrician who deals with this stuff all the time. He tells me no problem, he can do it, but in the end, he couldnt do it either. I rang around and it turns out nobody but Ford can do it.

This is acutally Illegal in Australia. Manufacturers HAVE TO make ALL repair information available to independent repairers yet Ford flat out refused. If this happened at home, id have just left it and forced them to give me the code, but I was stuck. After 5 hrs of fucking with it, id had enought and just wanted the car working. I towed it to Ford and they changed the code within 5 mins. 

This should not happen. If I buy a product, its mine to do what I want. Im not licensing it. Its my goddam property and Ford had no right to deny me the code. The car shouldnt even require one for me to change the settings...

3300 :: PayPal is now worth 33 times what eBay paid for it in 2002
FUCK PAYPAL.

I used to sell vintage laptops, old, slow laptops from the early 90's. The auction clearly listed the specs (e.g 1mb ram, 10mb hd, floppy etc). One guy got caught in a bidding war and ending up buying one for $400. It was shipped to him, arrived as described. He then did a ~~chargeback~~ dispute with paypal because the laptop did not contain a DVD player. Paypal sided with him , saying "expectations are that any laptop sold today should include a DVD player".

They froze the money, he shipped the laptop back. The screen was cracked and he had written on the screen in sharpie "go fuck yourself" - paypal gave him his money back. I was out shipping, ebay fees and of course had a broken laptop. I sent the photos to paypal, but they said they had no way of knowing that he was the one who did it and closed the case. I shut down my ebay business that very day and have never sold on ebay since.

Currently involved in court proceedings with PayPal and eBay, they are real cunts and spending thousands just trying to bully me and waste court and my time. They are both the most unethical companies I have had the misfortune to ever come across, with an ethos of "screw the customer, screw the law and just steal as much from them as possible".  The case is regarding I caught them overcharging, as well as charging for auctions that I never got paid for and refusing to refund, then banning me against their own T&Cs as I had the audacity to hold them accountable for their actions. I know so many people they have stolen from and ruined. eBay especially needs to be heavily regulated with an ombudsman service.

Just been screwed over again by PayPal and disputed the transaction by credit card as PayPal basically said they won't do anything due to an eBay site fuck up. Credit card ruled in my favour and refunded me.

I'm 18 and British, so it will be a good long while before I can afford a car (insurance is ridiculously expensive here if you live in the city), and I know I want to get an electric car at some point. They'll be too expensive for me to afford until I'm at least 30, but the technology will have moved a great way in 12 years' time and that fills me with anticipation of great things.

Naturally, like most teenage boys, I'm still itching to get my hands on a classic car to cruise around in but I've just sort of accepted the fact that the likelihood is I'll have an electric car when I'm older. Every generation before mine has done its bit in fucking up the planet, I'd love to be a part of of the first generation to proactively help save the environment. 

Too bad I won't be able to afford a house, my parents' and grandparents' generations made sure of that, and I will have a pitifully small state pension, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be another feckless, idle, naïve average Joe that assumes he has no part in looking after the rock he lives on. I want my kids to live in a world they can trust will still exist by the end of their lives, not filled with money worries and worries of homelessness like my generation is plagued with. 

I'm just a kid really, but there are thousands of kids like me who want to make this world better and see the value in it, and that gives me hope.

Can you imagine what it'd be like to go to work everyday and have a full tank filled for free everyday when you left work?

>My iPhone, for example, lets me know exactly how much data individual mobile apps have been using over a given period — couldn’t Comcast make a similar application that lets you see how much of your data is being gobbled up by your PlayStation or by Netflix?  
  
**Whoa, hold on there !!**  Under no circumstance should Comcast be logging detailed information about what IP addresses you are receiving data from and how much.  That is exactly what everyone was complaining that the NSA was doing.  We should *not* be suggesting that Comcast find a way to tell us what sites we are pulling data from.  To do that, they need to maintain a database of your internet history, and therefore create the risk that the information could be hacked or sold.  You might try and make the argument that they could at least summarize Netflix usage, but that is a dangerous cliff towards Net Neutrality issues by singling out a company for unusual usage monitoring.  I would rather Comcast remain as an ignorant ISP that provides a generic pipe, and has no idea what is flowing through it.  
  
An alternative would be to provide a utility that can access a data throughput log from the modem.  It can tell you in real time how much data is flowing in and out of your modem without telling you what the source is.  Even to suggest that the modem could log the data load by IP address is a potential problem, because if you can request the log data, so can Comcast ( and so can law enforcement ).  With just a real time data usage monitoring app for the modem, you could open and close programs or plug and unplug devices to see the change in data usage.  
  
I know that Comcast has the ability to monitor the internet usage from any user, but I would rather not make it standard practice to formally report it for all users.  It also reinforces the practice of monitoring usage by volume, i.e. data caps.  Lets not fuel that fire any more than necessary.  
  
Be very careful what you wish for....

For most people, I think Comcast should have immediately updating totals so you can test something and see how much data you're sending and receiving.

Of course, all the work they do to collect and present this information and the customer support and dissatisfaction may cost Comcast more than just upgrading their core to handle the traffic. Makes one wonder if there's an ulterior motive to the caps.

3268 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...
Yeah, this will be interesting.... on one hand, fuck AT&T and their bullshit practices, they should have never been allowed to OWN a city pole. On the other hand, they do own it and their concern is valid. Perhaps the city should be forced to buy all the poles and then this issue is done?
542
3268 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...
I read [AT&T's court filing](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wdrb/news/ATT_Utility_Lawsuit.pdf). Briefly, here are AT&T's arguments the Louisville's new pole ordinance exceeds the city's authority.

The first argument is that under FCC rules an entity with existing attachments is entitled to written notification if someone else's attachment is going to affect their facilities. They then have 60 days to modify their attachments to accommodate the new attachments. If they do not complete the work on time to accommodate the new attachments, then the entity wanting the new attachment can go ahead and do the work themselves.

Under the new ordinance the new attacher only has to provide notification if they think that their work is likely to cause a customer outage. If not they can simply go in themselves and move or modify the existing attachment.

This is at odds with the FCC rules, and AT&T argues that this should invalidate the ordinance.

The second argument AT&T makes is that while the Federal law does allow states to override FCC pole attachment rules in some circumstances, Kentucky state law vests such power exclusively in the Public Service Commission of Kentucky (and they cite Kentucky court cases confirming that this includes the power to regulate pole attachments). Thus, AT&T argues, the city government does not have authority to enact its ordinance.

These arguments seem on the face of it to be pretty decent. I'm curious what counterarguments the city will raise.

3268 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...
So much misinformation in this thread.  They are not denying access to Google, they are only requiring that Google goes through the proper channels first (just like everyone else who uses their poles).  Every telecommunications company uses ATT infrastructure and I have never once seen ATT deny a company.  

Google Fiber has become a political tool for mayors and these cities give everything to Google on a silver platter (free use of existing infrastructure, waive permit fees, etc.).  Google only comes to cities who provide this.  

I understand it's popular to hate ATT and love Google, but ATT does have an actual point here.
87
3268 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...
Yes, SOME get subsidies, but those subsidies in no way cover 100% of the poles in town and definitely has the equipment or the knowledge on pole installation.
7
3268 :: ATT sues City of Louisville after Google was granted access to poles ...
The reality is that AT&T and its competitors rent access to each other poles to be able to serve their respective customers. The deal is, Google doesn't want to pay like everyone else, so they're lobbying city councils and leveraging their brand among the local townsfolk/constituents to get free access to poles. If Google paid like the other telecom companies do, then the problem would also be solved this way...but they don't wanna.

Imminent Domain is not as bad as people make it seem, typically the property owner will receive something like 10% over market value and its value is based on an appraisal done by both the gov. and a personal appraiser if you chose using an average of the two usually, also you do not have to pay a capital gains tax because you are forced to incur the capital gain and therefore cannot be taxed on it, so effectively netting you 15% more than you would if you had sold the property for its market value and also not to mention you will not have to pay the 6 or 7% realtor fee if you had sold it through a realtor. Obviously not everyone cares about the money and may never want to sell the property but you are always compensated very very fairly for it.

3263 :: TPP Deal Just Signed: Paves Way for Authoritarian Technocracy
I find the credibility of this article hilarious. I went back and read over it three times and it never actually says what the treaty actually does, it just says random scary things. 

Looking at the glossary link for technocracy to see what they define as one contains the denial of global warming in it. 

It uses language like "puppet" and "authoritarian" when describing a trade deal that cuts or eliminates tariffs on thousands of different goods and holds signees to high labor, food safety, and environmental standards. If a country can't meet these standards, prior to implementation, they don't benefit from the low or eliminated tariffs and just aren't able to benefit from it. 

It says it includes 40% of the worlds GDP, but doesn't mention that it's only 12 countries (US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam) and doesn't include China, who would likely be unable to attain these kinds of standards and is forming their own low-standards counter treaty called the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) that includes 30% of global GDP and excludes the US. 
http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0S500220151011

And finally, it's worth mentioning that another country isn't involved: Russia. The article uses the word "western" in a negative sense and quotes from the English language Russian-state funded media company RT, which makes the use of the term "authoritarian" kind of funny. So, of course this is all these negative terms and scary things when it comes to a Russian perspective. 
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134

If that's your perspective, cool. I'm all for people disagreeing with the deal, I'm just surprised by some of the comments in here when there wasn't even any mention on what TPP actually does in the linked article.

Excuse me for being cynical.  You're also the same one who said our health insurance premiums would be less per month than our cell phone bill after the ACA would be pushed through.  Then a year or so later down the road, you said that if people have trouble paying for health insurance, they should give up things like cell phones.

This is bullshit.  I hope it gets killed by Congress.  That's one last bastion of hope for the Republican controlled seats is that they protect them 'Murrican jobs they caterwaul about all the time.  People carry on about scary fucking socialism and how capitalism is king here, but then seem to forget just how morally and financially bankrupt we've become and have allowed corporations to waffle stomp the middle and lower class because they damn well can fucking afford it.

All our entry level and blue collar jobs are shipped overseas while businesses here recruit heavily for H1B's because they can keep the overhead for salary ridiculously low.

How soon before countries start outsourcing here because our labor force is cheap?

I've always loved [this XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1357/) regarding the issue of "Free Speech".  The fact that Reddit is beginning to "show the door" to the skeevier subreddits and their posters does not mean they're infringing on anybody's free speech rights in any way.  Reddit is under no obligation to give anybody and everybody a platform to express any views or share anything that could negatively impact the site as a whole.  

Voat will quickly learn the same lessons, and will implement similar rules once the media pressure, legal issues, issues with funding, etc. become too much to bear.

Let's not forget that the technology in Tor was developed by the U.S. Navy and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as a means of allowing U.S. government agencies to securely communicate with each other. Tor's background isn't some wacky idea cooked up by a bunch of conspiracy theorists. It's something developed by a team of mathematicians and engineers to protect American interests.

Disney has seen the future and it's not traditional TV. They signed the agreement in 2012, moving away from Starz, so they've seen it for awhile. I'll have to pat Disney on the back for not creating their own video service, since they could have done it. Disney also created the Marvel Unlimited digital comic book service, which would have made me poop myself if that existed back when I was into comic books. They never figured out how to make a good video game based on a movie though.

Everyone else is so far behind they are all fighting for 10th place.  Only Universal is on top of the bottom feeders this year, just because they had more luck with releases than others have. 

Comcast own NBC/Universal and Comcast is trying to level a Netflix Tax on all their users by trying to charge for going over new caps that only affect people who use the Internet for watching Netflix, etc.

This is, of course, why we shouldn't allow regional monopolies for megacorporations that actually merge with content creators and now act as ISPs as well...in essence competing with themselves.  Ahem.

Comcast has effectively created a button that they can push whenever they want more money.

Without divulging how they even calculate your data usage, no tools provided to the consumer to calculate data usage themselves, and no accountability for the process at all, any concept of a limit or cap is meaningless. There is no way to know if you exceeded your limit or not, and thus Comcast can just decide you did and charge you more.

How is this not fraud?

This is the part that gets me right in the kidneys:

* Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has compared the caps and overage charges to buying gas or electricity, saying that the more you use, the more you pay.

Great, Comcast.  If you want to bill us like the utility companies do, you can submit your internet services to the same type of regulation and consumer cost-protections that govern the utilities.  Which means a state-run agency will evaluate your cost of operating, determine a profit margin that is fair to both customers and suppliers, and you'll have to agree to be bound by those laws.  And I believe the last independent study reported that providing 50GB of internet traffic cost... What was it again... Oh, yeah, just under 4¢.  So that means my Comcast internet bill will be changing from $166 a month to about $0.40.  

I support this plan.  Let's bill our internets like utilities!

Forcing an ISP to block traffic to a certain place because it MIGHT be used to download illegal content is the same as forcing the DOT to block roads that lead to a nightclub because people MIGHT go there and do drugs. The DOT should block roads to anyplace that something illegal MIGHT happen.

When will they learn that they cannot kill this by taking down a site. Like the heads of a Hydra, another will promptly take it's place. It is similar to people trying to remove embarrassing content from the web, it almost never works and typically exacerbates the problem. Yes, this will set precedent and make it easier to do this to future incarnations, but with the current model of the internet, it is just not effective. 
I'm not condemning nor condoning piracy. Instead of trying to temporarily ease the symptoms and butchering the free web in the process,  they should look to the source of the issue. IP/copyright laws made in the era before the web are out-dated and need to evolve with society and technology.

3220 :: IP address of Uber hack was traced to the CTO of Lyft.
Most of the top-level comments in this thread are taking the title at face value.  They shouldn't.

If you read the article, it says that Uber posted its private credentials in a public GitHub repo.  The IP they are investigating is one that viewed that repo (and hence may have learned their credentials).  It was not one implicated in any breach.

Even if the IP belonged to Lyft's CTO, there are plenty of legitimate reasons he could have been looking at an open-source repo.  He might have been researching something that had nothing to do with downloading Uber's database.  Even if he knew the key was there, he could have just been looking at the page incredulously ("WTF, they really posted a private key on GitHub?!") without any intention of using it to impersonate an Uber employee.

The title is a lie.  It implies a link between the IP address being investigated and the data breach.  There's no way of showing that's a valid correlation.

Ive had t-mobile for several years now and I love it.  The thing I dont love is their signal strength.  I live in Phoenix, AZ, a mostly horizontal city (as opposed to a vertical city like NYC or somewhere like that where buildings are expected to fuck your service) and I get shit signal strength just about everywhere I go.  At home?  1 bar.  At work?  0-1 bar.  Thank god for wifi calling.  But I shouldnt really have to rely on wifi calling to make the phone work.  Once Im on wifi, the "t-mobile" part of the equation goes out the window.  At that point it just becomes a handheld voip and reddit toy.

If T-Mobile gets their signal strength under control they will be unstoppable.

I just switched to T-Mobile. I love the service but the coverage is still horrendous. 

Domestic roaming also only gives you 100mb per month.. Which is pretty much useless. ATT gives you 400mb.

If there is something T-Mobile needs to do better, it's domestic roaming data increase.

Thats a pretty stupid title. All Watson does is categorizes and tags TED talks. Then people can search the talks by these tags. Its same as building a word cloud from an article.

Is it impressive? In RNN field, damned yes. is it same as "Watson answers your deepest questions". Not even close. The largest RNN is yet to get to a neuron number that any higher mammal has.

You can even do this yourself (albeit using shortcuts and existing solutions). Run ted talks through text processors which will generate the approximate text strings. then just rate the words by frequency. filter all the unneeded speech stuff and you end up with a decent categorization and tagging of the video in question.

I used to like them when I was younger, but they've really lost the power to captivate and educate. Most of the talks now are bland and uninspired, presenting unexciting, well-known information...or maybe I was just young and naive and it was never good.

When I first took my current job I did this, the tasks they had me doing were very tedious, so I used Perl to basically automate my entire job, I really only had about 20-30 minutes of work to do each day, mostly monitoring my scripts. While that sounds good, trying to pretend you are busy for 8 hours isn't easy, and to make things worse my manager was very much into micro managing, I had a meeting every morning about what I did yesterday and what I would do today. Luckily for me that manager had no idea what I did. It got to the point where it was so boring I started to look for a new job, but we had a reorg and I got a new manager that saw what I did and got me a raise because of it and started me on more challenging tasks.

Apologies to the author, but this article is *shit* and betrays that exactly zero research was done.

> Narkoz says that the scripts came from one of his coworkers who left for another company, 

I don’t know where the author gets this information from — the GitHub project definitely doesn’t claim that these are the original scripts, nor that it was Narkoz’ coworker. In fact, the GH project page says:

> Based on a true story

And the scripts are a (mostly poor) attempt to *reprogram* these scripts. They are also nothing special at all, and, lastly, they are incomplete. In fact, they are just empty wrappers, missing most of the actual logic:

`fucking-coffee.rb` doesn’t actually contain the crucial network communication with the coffee machine, [it’s a stub](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/c6373cc7625e879039c37b37a2d23f1cd2405f58/fucking_coffee.rb#L16-L21). Likewise for [`kumar-asshole.rb`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/c6373cc7625e879039c37b37a2d23f1cd2405f58/kumar_asshole.rb#L17).

Not that that’s a problem. But the scripts are much less amazing than the story implies — honestly, the amazing part in the stories was reverse engineering the network protocol of a coffee machine^(1). And “Business Insider” being unable to distinguish between a true story and a few mostly empty shell scripts … well, I guess that’s just par for the course. It’s still exceedingly poor journalism. It’s Buzzfeed “journalism”: taking an online story and slightly reformulating it, while distorting a few facts.

---

^(1) It’s worth noting that not many coffee machines even possess such capability and it seems doubtful that this pat of the story at least was strictly true. None of the discussions of the story so far have found a likely candidate for the machine in question.

Actual proper title:

Company with largest ISP bill in the US (based upon their service taking 1/3rd of the entire internet bandwidth in the US) is working on new technology to cut their ISP bill.

And encoding cartoons differently has nothing to do with "rigor". They're not half-assing an MLP encode, they are doing it in a different way which is more efficient for cartoons.

It's smart business, caps or no. They should have done it sooner. Heck, people are starting to use these services on airplanes. This will help them access that market better. Amazon Prime is actually offered for free on JetBlue right now. Netflix wants to do as well as they can to catch up.

So the first hit of crack is free. Internet.org is a scam, it's a way to *introduce* people to the internet, in hopes they'll sign up and pay for the real deal. The trick is to get them to invest in a device first.

You know what's funny? Everyone here and in the other Facebook thread is circlejerking about how much it sucks, but they haven't even read the article. Not only that, you probably have a Facebook account too!

I deleted my Facebook account four or five years ago; that's how you say "Fuck You" to Facebook. If you still have a Facebook account, you're only allowed to say "Keep fucking me please." You are currently an "investor" in Facebook and are helping to position it. I had two major concerns when I deleted my account:

1) **Social Atmosphere** - This is the problem that most people overlook, imo. I didn't like the manner in which Facebook promoted socialization. Everyone has a profile pic they try to *look* cool or hot or funny in, people only tag themselves in photos which contribute to that *self-image*, everyone has a list of qualified *friends*, and you have to be very *cautious* about which photos you like and which you comment on. What a rotten and toxic social atmosphere that is, where you have to remain self-conscious about yourself 24-7, you judge others all the time, and you promote a bullshit surface image of yourself and likely start to believe in that image. You have to be a pretty shallow person and a pretty big loser to participate that kind of social network. I realize people relax their activity on Facebook, especially as they get older and a little more mature, but you have to wonder what kinds of psychological effects this website is going to have on the teens and even pre-teens who grow up attached to their phones and Facebook. If you think you're older and more mature now and don't really care about Facebook, then prove it. You have to delete your Facebook to prove it, otherwise you're just full of shit.

2) **Privacy Concerns** - There's only one thing you have to remember: everything you do on the internet is permanent. There is no going back, ever. Everything is recorded. So if you use your real name anywhere, it's going to follow you around for the rest of your life. What are the first things employers do when researching an applicant? They look for you on Facebook and they Google your name. Sure, it's all private now, but it's only a matter of time before Facebook's popularity drops and they start selling that data. If that doesn't happen, and Facebook retains the stranglehold on social networking, then expect that every website will require you to log in to Facebook to comment or use their service. That's an even scarier alternative because nothing you do will ever be anonymous again. Everyone will always know what websites you visit and who you are when you're commenting on a news article; say goodbye to anonymity and what makes the internet great.

I kind of went on a rant and just want to quickly tie this back to the internet.org ordeal. I'm not hating on internet.org because I've read the article, I'm hating on internet.org because it's affiliated with Facebook. I don't trust Facebook and I don't trust Mark Zuckerberg, so there's no way I'm going to trust internet.org. Not only do I not trust internet.org, but I distrust it; I am suspicious of it and anything Mark Zuckerberg does given his track record with Facebook. I deleted my Facebook and I don't like what the network stands for, so I'm allowed to say this. If you still have a Facebook, then you're not allowed to; put your money where your mouth is or shut up.

Once the populace gets online competitors will come into the market with unrestricted internet and piss on their parade.  I would expect it to play out sort of like AOL.  AOL did all of this shit except they made you pay for it.  The second real internet came to town everybody jumped ship and AOL died.  Aside from the obviously misleading name it is no different than AOL.

3135 :: No one, Tim Cook declares, ‘Should have a key that turns a billion lo...
In Sword Art Online II there is a story arc where peoples homes have a 4-digit "emergency responder" override that can be used to unlock the door.  This code is exploited by a group of kids to murder other players while they're in the game and unaware of their surroundings.  It climaxes in an unsettlingly realistic rape scene where a "friend" who's been rejected multiple times forces himself on one of the girls in the main story.

I wonder how many people would feel good about law enforcement having a backdoor after seeing it play out like this.  They couldn't even keep Snowden from accessing things he shouldn't have.  We only know about Snowden because he chose to take the ethical path (at great cost to himself).  Think about all the leaked information from the NSA that isn't public because it's quietly sold to cybercriminals and foreign state actors.

The whole thing is really ridiculous (the fact that I can use anime to make the point should say something).  IMHO Director James Comey should be asked to resign.  It's unacceptable for the FBI to be bullying a major technology company so that it can violate the US constitution.

The master signing key for apple has almost certainly been stolen, the problem is that one you sign software updates with that key and it gets out, the key is worthless. It will be deprecated, apple users may have to go get work done on their phones, and apple the company will have every lawyer in the country gunning straight for the NSA. It is a really big cannon but it fires one shot.

Now, if you are in the FBI/NSA's shoes and think that there is actual information of critical interest to the national security on the bernadino phone, you can spin up a team, build an attack update, sign it with the key, and use it. All within a secure facility and with federal charges waiting for anyone who even speaks a word of what was done there.

But it doesn't have critical information. It is critical only as a prop in a teledrama, and the only reason it is important is that it connected to a terror attack on american soil. This entire debate is a farce, designed to build legal support for legally mandated and functionally unlimited government access to all devices.

Anything that can be stolen will be stolen.

This is a lot more widespread than just Denver.  I supported a government department in Canada which had access to the criminal databases, and everyone routinely used them for personal reasons.  Second time we had a new IT guy show up onsite, the office admin told him "Oh we know all about you, we looked you up in the system".

Problem is, there has always been an assumption that police won't abuse the power, so they have never gone through the cost to implement effective auditing.  If they don't have a process by which some percentage of searches are validated as acceptable, and identifying abuse (and taking action to prevent) then of course the system will be abused.....it's free knowledge and power without consequence!

i like how in this article about IMAX being annoyed that they used IMAXs name in an previous article, which had nothing to do with IMAX, but just mentioned IMAX once. that they managed to mention IMAX 29 times in the article about how IMAX doesn't like people using the word IMAX. 
568
3123 :: IMAX’s absurd attempt to censor Ars Technica article about SteamVR
They made this point in the article too, but IMAX doesn't even mean what it used to mean. 

When I was a kid, IMAX meant a huge kickass screen that filled your entire field of view and made you feel like you were in space /underwater/on a safari, or whatever they were showing at the museum.

I remember the first time I went to a theater with an "IMAX" screen to see a movie; I was expecting to see those same enormous screens. Instead I got a marginally larger screen with louder sound and slightly better 3D. 

Hooray?

3123 :: IMAX’s absurd attempt to censor Ars Technica article about SteamVR
The funniest part is that it seems that IMAX misunderstood the statement being made. They weren't saying that SteamVR was itself a replacement for or comparable to an IMAX theater, they were saying that it's *like* IMAX purely in that it's heads and tails better than its competition. There is nothing in that statement that is anything less than absolute praise for IMAX.

Not that either interpretation of the article is grounds for their letter. It's amazing how many corporate attorneys these days seem to have little or no understanding of trademark and copyright law, and seemingly just spend their days sending out baseless C&Ds hoping that the people receiving them don't know anything about the law either.

So, ultimately this is a failure to both understand trademark law, and an absolute failure in reading comprehension.

A game designer 'went on to predict it could take off with consumers despite the fact that the room-sized VR system takes up a lot of space. "It’s like saying, 'I have an **IMAX** theater in my house,' '

And IMAX contacted Ars  and told  that the story required a retraction, because it included a brief reference to IMAX—included without IMAX's permission. "Any unauthorized use of our trademark is expressly forbidden,"

>"We believe that your incorrect reference to IMAX when describing this product is misleading to readers as we do not believe that it is possible for a virtual reality system to replicate the experience of an IMAX theater, which is provided by cutting edge projection and sound technology on screens up to 35.72 metres. We request that all future articles regarding this "room-scale" virtual reality system make no reference to our registered trademark."

When VR HMDs reach 4K resolution per eye, IMAX is all but finished unless you're absolutely dead set on seeing movies in person with others.

The fact is, you can have ridiculously huge screens in any environment of your choosing in VR. I know because I've already done this with my Oculus Rift DK2...

The resolution isn't quite good enough for me yet, but there's nothing quite like slipping on the HMD and watching an episode of, say, The Simpsons in your own private and humongous theater on the fucking MOON.

IMAX, like other traditional businesses, is about to become extinct.

Its almost like...if you offer the services people want, they will pay for them.
276
3118 :: Netflix: BitTorrent traffic being killed by streaming video sites
More likely, torrent traffic has remained at similar levels over the years (an HD file is roughly the same size today [or smaller] as it was three years ago) while streaming services have grown in popularity, such that the overall percentage of traffic from torrents has fallen.

Indeed, the fact that torrent traffic is still overwhelmingly the largest use of **upstream** bandwidth suggests that little has changed in torrent use, but that services that are downstream only have grown.

Netflix traffic going up does not mean torrent traffic declines, just their share of total traffic has.
39
3118 :: Netflix: BitTorrent traffic being killed by streaming video sites
Can someone explain this to me? Last night I searched Netflix for three movies that I wanted to watch and (surprise!) none of them were available.  While I agree that streaming *is* most convieniient, torrenting is still the only way to get a lot of content.

Seems like all that's going on is that torenting activity is declining in response to streaming content becoming more accessable.  However, so long as streaming content is not 100% inclusive (or if Netflix decides to signifigantly increase it's pricing) torrenting will persist.

I don't really care very much about TV/movies, so netflix is a great marriage of convenience and quality.

Takes about 10 and a half minutes to crack. When people ask "why do you wipe brand new computers before using them". This is why

EDIT:

I did a bit of research on the topic and here is what I found:

* The culprit seems to be the Lenovo ShareIt app. 

* Password is hard coded into the app (I haven't been able to test it but there is no mention of changing the password) (EDIT: confirmed. sorta)

* There is a secure mode which encrypts the files

* This is a standard Windows application so anyone who is concerned about their privacy can remove it. 

And while one can remove it, I have no idea if its enabled by default (so an unsuspecting user could be exposed) however it seems that you do have to enable it. Anyone can download it so I am going to test it briefly.

Edit 2: I very briefly tested the app and here is what I found

* There is a secure mode which according to the app "requires a new password every time a device connects"

* The app does not run in the background. There is no ShareIt process when the app is not running and the ShareIt service is stopped when not in the app so an unsuspecting user who does not know what this is should not be exposed by simply using their commuter. 


Feel free to correct me on any information above that is incorrect.

> "When Lenovo ShareIT for Windows is configured to receive files, a WiFi hotspot is set with an easy password (12345678). Any system with a WiFi network card could connect to that hotspot by using that password. The password is always the same," said Core Security.

Mildly amusing as it is, I doubt at this point the actual password makes any difference. If it is static, once it's publicly known it can be a million random symbols, it's still useless, being one Google query away.

Does it not count because no one is listening to someone else's voice? (Kind of like the NSA claimed they weren't "collecting" all of that information they were storing on their servers, because it doesn't count until a human looks at it.)

3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
[Expected this.](http://i.imgur.com/KocXJ.jpg)
108
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
Here is a video of it in action:

http://youtu.be/2_5K4kmnsL4

I can't see this outputting near the same amount of energy as a similar sized wind turbine though, you would have to have thousands of them.  I do like it for its simplicity and lack of moving parts. Seems best suited to developing 3rd world countries. 
447
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
"They’re hoping to have their first product, a 9-foot, 100-watt turbine that will be used in developing countries, ready before the end of the year. The Mini, it’s 41-foot counterpart, will be ready in a year."

"Based on field testing, the Mini ultimately captures 30 percent less than conventional wind turbines, but that shortcoming is compensated by the fact that you can put double the Vortex turbines into the same space as a propeller turbine."

this is so misleading it's not even funny. they can put TWO of these in place of a standard wind turbine and claim to make up for that 30% lower amount of power because of this. what are they comparing this turbine to? it sure sounds like they are comparing it to a 30 year old wind turbine that is similar in height. 

* so here's the issue, wind turbines now are not 41 feet tall (not even close). 
* they produce megawatts, not hundreds of watts (or even killawatts)
* doubling the amount of turbines in the SAME space lowers the amount of usable land for farmers (already a complaint with standard wind turbines
* doubling the amount of these also doubles the amount of power distribution required (a big cost to the owners). 

there is a reason wind turbines are getting taller with bigger blades. the price per megawatt production is LOWERED. even though this new design may seem cheap, it requires increasing the price per megawatt to match up to conventional wind turbines. 

it would still be better for developing countries to purchase decomissioned turbines from non developing countries. 
103
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
Can anybody find *any* actual documentation for their claims of reduced costs etc.?

Their homepage has no actual calculations and I have not been able to find any whitepapers, patents or other documentation - not even a spreadsheet documenting what power output one of their bendable sticks actually produces in a given wind.

It may not be a scam, but it smells a bit funny to me.
23
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
Where's the data?

I'm highly skeptical because, well, you can't harness much energy from resonance.

Yes, resonance can do huge damage.  But, that's because the energy is stored & in-phase, & over time is not released, but fed back into the system.  

So, from a conservation of energy standpoint, resonance is storage, not production or harvesting.  

Vertical wind harnessing has been experimented with many times, and horizontal axis has won every contest & still does.
135
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
Yeah, emphasis on the question mark.

The volume of wind intercepted is very, very low.  So it may be "capturing 30% of the wind energy" *of the wind intercepted*, which is a tiny fraction of a comparable turbine, which sweeps out a very large area in comparison.

And while it may not have rotating parts, it has flexing parts which creates even more serious problems with fatigue.

Very little there there.

23
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
/cynicism

Do you think one day they'll develop trees? Ones that sway in the wind, and the constant change in compression of the cellulose fibers causes them to pass charges accumulated on one end of the tree through the trunk and into the other end? Maybe they'll turn wind turbines into giant air filtration devices while they're at it, and make them self-healing and self-replicating too, because why should we have to get other people to build these things?

I think it'll be fun anyway, and we need to learn how to do that stuff for Mars, right?
10
3098 :: The Future of Wind Turbines? No Blades
Have you ever seen anything attached to the ground flap uncontrollably in the wind? That's what is happening here, but in a bigger and controlled scale. I want to read more about it and see if they can tune that giant joint to vibrate in different ways to make more of that sweet sweet magnetic induced energy.

No blades. 

How fucking cool is that.

They're like giant pitch forks in the sky.

I am interested to see how well these handle the fatigue of wobbling back and forth over time.  No moving parts =/= nothing that wears out.

From my experiences in China, most people are either oblivious to net censorship or are thoroughly accustomed to it and don't really care. Freedom of thought and information isn't held in nearly as high regard as it is in the west. People are more or less content to to live their lives within the bubble that their government has created for them. China has its own "version" of most international sites and their users seem content at least to continue using that.

You did not find yourself on that site, as many will not, and people that subscribe for more details on a person are almost always disappointed and want their money back.

Reddit should not be allowing these ads, not because they give out sensitive info but because they're basically a scam.

* ... up to $19.99 each
* they'll offer you a "trial" report for $1
* For less than the price of a bottle of soda, even?

It is also available on the internet for money, but you pay for the fact that you do not have to make the call to the authorities.

3084 :: Reddit is selling ad space to a doxxing website
Flaired as misleading.  Doxxing is the act of removing someone's anonymity.  While finding out personal information about someone is part of Doxxing... the defining characteristic of doxxing is the removal of anonymity.  The site referenced does not aid in removing anonymity.

This is the fundamental distinction between doxxing and background checks.  **Doxxing violates someone's expectation of privacy.**

Back when there was a high corporate tax rate, the government didn't need to invest in R&D.

If they're going to take us in a Minority Report facial recognition everywhere direction, at least show us the real end state results.

>Stanley pointed out that while Facebook may have powerful facial recognition technology, using Facebook is opt-in (and it’s pretty obvious your face is being documented, all you need to do is tag a photo). Surreptitiously being scanned when you’re walking down the street is another issue entirely, Stanley said.

Not really. You can appear in pictures posted on Facebook, and be tagged in pictures on Facebook, without being aware of it or joining Facebook yourself. If there's a big difference, it's that you aren't getting arrested based on how Facebook identifies you or misidentifies you.

We tend to get both excited and complacent when an organization manages to launch many rockets almost flawlessly. We assume the kinks and danger has been figured out. What we need to understand is that there will *always* be an inherent and present danger to space travel and transportation. Every single time. There will never be a time ( at least until we figure out a non-explosive propulsion system) where we can say space travel is 100% safe. It's always a roll of the dice when you are being transported via a series of controlled explosions. We should investigate and make sure it doesn't happen again, but the important thing is to move on and make progress.

[Kyllo v. United States (2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyllo_v._United_States), held that the use of a thermal imaging, or FLIR, device from a public vantage point to monitor the radiation of heat from a person's home was a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus required a warrant.

Not sure how this would work cause they would need someone following on the exact other side of the house to actually get any kind of picture. Xray vision irl doesn't work like super man's, there needs to be a source of radiation, and a receiver with the desired object to be scanned between the two. Relying on scatter radiation would really only produce a foggy screen with no actual discernible images. I have done both medical and industrial xray, so yeah, take that for what you will as far as my source or whatever.

They were [clearly using](http://cdn.bgr.com/2015/07/proxyham-900-mhz-wifi-shot.jpg?w=624) a [ubiquiti M900](http://cdn3.bigcommerce.com/s-blpsc02m/products/864/images/295/ROCKETM9__63579.1412961746.1280.1280.jpg?c=2) with the [ubiquiti yagi](http://doubleradius.com/media/wysiwyg/ubiquiti/Ubiquiti-airMAX-YAGI-Antenna-Datasheet.jpg) antenna which is a violation of FCC rules if they are operating at 1 watt. Those radios require professional installation as stated in both the datasheet and the manual and they stress that you could be in violation of the law if you misuse them.

and to be clear, you are not doing a 2.5 mile link with any speed unless you are violating rule 15. your talking 8, 10dB difference in loss over distance under FSPL rules. which is the range doubled twice. wifi works about 100m. so you are talking 400 meters while being legal; further than that you are either in a great RF environment or you are breaking the rules. 

The fine is 10k a day plus 100k if found in violation if not more.  

my bet? FCC showed up at their door having df-ed to find them and they realized that 

1) it is pretty easy to track a powerful transmitter 

and 

2) pretty damn expensive to violate fcc rule 15.


from a hardware perspective the entirety of the stuff they did was put a small computer with a wifi card and the ubquiti into a box.  they basically created a long distance wifi relay.

Hopefully I can throw my two cents in here.
I am a ham radio operator, and it has been a while since I have used my radio and such so I lost a lot of knowledge but I'll try to hopefully not be wrong..


But.
900mhz is around the 33cm band for ham operators. I know that the FCC probably would not allow these to be sold in the United States due to the distance the signal travels. Because of that, my only assumption due to how a 33cm radio wave acts, these things have a not a lot but more than normal amount of energy being used for something that transmits around 33cm. So thus it would cause a decent amount of interference to other people using radio signals around that frequency. Thankfully, cell phones use to run on the 33cm band but they were upped to somewhere about 1000mhz. But back on track, the FCC would not like this at all. I promise.

I wish people would knock off the track standing in traffic. Putting your foot down shows that you have no intent of taking off. Plus, when it's done in traffic it's dangerous. If your ass if track standing and you fall at the wrong time and no one notices, you can absolutely get run over. I saw this shit happen with a woman and a box truck at a stop sign and many people's lives were changed that day. She was dead almost instantly. Imagine the horror of the driver and onlookers, not to mention the horror her family suffered, as well as what she must have felt in her final moments. 

I rode a fixed gear in Chicago (flat!) for a short time before I moved to a hilly area. I really did love the control I had over my ride and it was a zippy, light little thing. It's not hard to put your damn foot down and start again. It takes minimal effort and is much safer. I didn't use clips on my shoes, though, but if having your feet clipped in impairs your commute-riding, then you shouldn't be using them.

The car wasn't in the wrong here... It thought the cyclist had started moving forward, and he had... The only way to fix this is to give cyclists an "error box" in which they're allowed to move around in and the car will ignore it, along with maybe an error speed, if the cyclist exceeds *x* speed within their error box the car will flag it and stop.

2998 :: Ex-NSA chief backs Apple on iPhone ‘back doors’
This is only tangentially related, but I was in the Air Force and Gen. Hayden came onto base to give a talk about the role of the NSA in respect to battlefield intelligence. It was an OK talk, nothing to write home about, but he was a generally affable guy.

After the talk I hit up the bathroom. I was at a urinal, a second lieutenant was to my left, and there were about 3 officers waiting at the entrance to take a piss.

Suddenly, and without warning, a captain who was standing in line yelled "ATTENTION!" 

All the training I had received kicked in, and I went to full attention... but I was still pissing. My dick flopped down and I was pissing on my boots. Took a few seconds to stop.

Then I heard Gen. Hayden, practically yelling:

"Jesus Christ, at ease! Captain, you don't call people to attention in a bathroom. You made that poor kid piss himself!"

The captain looked at the ground, mumbled "Sorry, sir. Sorry, airman." 

Then Gen. Hayden went into the stall and I presume he took a poop. The end.

**Edit:**

I'm sorry, but you can't be responsible for implementing the most massive, unprecedented surveillance program in the history of the world, and then call this crossing the line after you retire.

The U.S. government continues to invade the privacy of the American people and the rest of the world in the name of preventing what is essentially a non-issue, without any evidence to show that it is actually an effective means. When the Snowden story broke, you knew they were just going to lay low and keep quiet while changing nothing.

Imo we need more publicity on the subject. 

Even though most people who own a computer are incapable of checking the power cable on their modem when their Internet "suddenly" goes down, almost everyone should be smart enough to understand that privacy is underrated. Willingly trading privacy that we used to have for security that the government and these corporations are promising us is a mistake.

Just because a tech company is involved does not make it a post about technology. This is a political post and should go in /r/politics.

With that said, the list is quite simplified and biased toward two specific types of american legislation, but forgets the entire past of companies. Like how [Yahoo ratted out and helped persecute Chinese journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Tao), or that [LinkedIn sells your contact information to advertisers](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/10/14/3579327/linkedin-gets-sued-for-selling-your-professional-data/), or [the entire Windows 10 privacy debacle](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-violates-your-privacy-by-default-heres-how-you-can-protect-yourself/), ... or ^^I'm ^^gonna ^^hate ^^myself ^^defending ^^them how [Comcast fights copyright trolls](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/20/ip_address_search_shows_prenda_copyright_trolls_seeded_smut_then_sued/).

Then there's AT&T, that no matter what type of legislation or standards they support, they have [Room 641A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A), which makes them the leader of Team NSA. How does one actually go about supporting ECPA reform while simultaneously providing a bulk feed of all data direct to the NSA?

2977 :: North America is out of IPv4 addresses—for really real this time. ARI...
So an IPv4 address can range anywhere between 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 giving a total of 4,294,967,296 possible addresses. This may sound like a lot but if you consider every device that touches a network requires an IP address to be routed through the internet, then it starts looking a whole lot smaller. Now there have been stop gap measures to conserve IP address such as NAT but they were only ever temporary. 

SO it finally looks like we are out of ipv4 addresses but luckily the Internet powers knew this was going to happen and they have another addressing scheme in place called ipv6, for when it did. This is what an IPv6 address looks like :
2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348 You will notice that ipv6 uses letters as well as numbers.
Providing a total address pool of :340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.

 There is quite a difference between ipv4 addresses and ipv6, well this difference translates into virtually all of the networking processes used by network admins. This has resulted in a lot of push back in the networking world to adopt the new address scheme. Ipv4 is familiar and cozy : Ipv6 is big, scary, and new.

I understand the move to v6, but I think there is a little bit of misunderstanding in this thread.

While yes, every device that hits the net gets an IP address, most of the time those up addresses are handed out by a dhcp server and are super basic/repeatable.

For instance.... Your home network is most likely set up with a 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x address scheme. There are millions of the exact same 10.0.0.1 address because that is pretty common for your internal router/firewall/or whatever device you assign to the .1 address.

But what this article is saying, is that we have run out of external ip addresses or public ip addresses. It's the IP address you get from the isp, and what ip your router routes internal traffic to. If you google whatsmyip, you will see that your IP address is different from the one on your machine... as that is your public ip.

Still it's a major issue, but the notion that every device that's connected to the net is taking those ips, is a little misrepresented to people who aren't familiar with how the net works.

Yes I know I painted with too much of a broad stroke and made some generalizations, and not all infrastructures are built this way...

According to the cable companies, it's not *all* their fault- on the other end of  the service are the content providers like ESPN, who keep raising *their* rates. A good portion of a typical cable bill goes to subsidize these costs whether or not you actually watch the content.

'But the rules for the official Oculus app store are important, since that’s how most mainstream consumers may experience virtual reality.'

I'm not exactly a mainstream consumer, I've been using the DK2 for a while on a computer I built myself. But curated app stores are a very recent phenomenon, and one that's never really taken off on PC even amongst casual PC users. How many people actually use the Windows 8 App Store? 

The only widely used platform is Steam, but this article seems to make out that outside of these curated stores programs won't get traction. It's not like the iOS app store where you have to void your warranty to sideload apps, or even Android where you have to toggle a security setting from the default. It's like suggesting that a game like Crysis or Mass Effect 3 will fail because they're not on Steam. I doubt the Oculus official program store is going to significantly affect the way the VR industry heads in.

2960 :: Microsoft Edge is faster than other browsers: up to 112 percent faste...
OK, lets see some real world usage benchmarks. Remember, IE9 was the fastest in sunspider tests and that turned out to be a crock of shit too.

Backstory: IE9 seemingly blew away chrome, ff, safari, etc on the sunspider benchmarks. If you were looking at pure benchmark numbers like this article is, you would think that IE9 was absurdly fast. Anyone that has used IE9 vs chrome or any other browser knows thats absolutely not true. 

Turns out that IE9 was developed with a function that outright skipped the tests (not specifically intentional to this test) due to "dead code elimination". This had the effect of not running the tests at all and simply saying it was done. Imagine a race where you instruct a runner to go around the ring 20 times. IE9 essentially stood up at the starting line and said "i'm done".

For even shittier benchmarking tactics, read up on the whole 179.art benchmarks where it was found that many major players like Sun Microsystems baked in code to specifically detect that it was running a benchmark and cheated it's nuts off. What essentially happened here is like getting an answers sheet to a test, memorizing all of the answers, then getting 100% and claiming you're the smartest kid in the class.

Can someone explain to me why everyone just accepts stingray devices as a fact of life?  Why are the network operators not coming up with protections, as this is a direct assault on their network and network reliability?  Why aren't encryption measures used?

I did some research and found out that it's because 2G has really weak encryption.  Stingray devices only work on 2G.  If they broadcast a strong 2G signal, all the phones will use it and it can be seamlessly decrypted.

Ok, so encryption algorithms are found to be weak all the time.  What happens?  Companies and software deprecate the old insecure algorithms and no longer support them.

So can someone tell me why there isn't a big push by Google, Apple, cell phone makers, and cell networks to deprecate 2G?  I can't even find anyone asking this question.

If Stingrays are "simply too powerful" then something is severely wrong with the way cellular phones work. Why does my phone want to blindly connect to any tower it sees?

I'm not sure how this will work without the phone trying to contact the fake tower, but that's not my job to fix.

There are two types of people arguing this issue: those who understand encryption, and those who don't.

Fuck.

I'm not an Apple fanboy by a long shot, but I fully side with them on this issue, and I'm glad they are fighting so hard for it. Most people fail to see the long-term ramifications of the legal precedent that will be set by this.

The key to Japan's victory is going to be finding a teenage boy to pilot their mech who is filled with insecurities, self-doubt, and parent issues, but who finds the strength inside himself to overcome the arrogant, overconfident American rival after appearing to have been defeated halfway through the match.

The "acceptance" is almost 12 hours ago already, I just had to wait for at least some site to report on it to be able to post it here (as I cannot post the YouTube videos alone). lol

2936 :: It's on: Team Japan accepts US challenge to a giant robot duel
So, let me get this straight - the US has just challenged to a robot duel the country that created Evangelion, Macross and Gundam.

What could possibly go wrong?

I hope this ends up as BattleBots on a larger scale with 2 ton hammers spinning at ~100 rpm while the other frantically tries to table flip the other.

They should fight in water or a model city area, like Pacific rim, just to make it that much more epic. This is literally a mega sized version of battle bots. 

*Serious child like giddiness ensues*

I swear, if the American mech isn't piloted by a blonde guy in a trenchcoat with a British accent, then we will have missed a truly great opportunity.

2920 :: Google research finds that most security questions for account recove...
I've never understood the point of security questions.  They make such a big deal about password complexity and length, and then force you to choose from a small list of easy-to-know-by-anyone questions.  It's a deliberate back-door to your account that's far less secure, and accessible by everyone.

If they're going to provide your account with two login methods, surely it makes sense that both of them are adequately secure.  Otherwise, just forget the password altogether and let me log in with my cat's name.

Why don't more sites let users write their own security questions? At least then you're not as likely to be shoehorned into something ridiculously easy like "Favorite superhero."

Too true. 

I once had a very basic computer class on Microsoft Apps. It was super boring, so I spent most of the class on facebook. One day I went to login to facebook and found that some poor sap had let the browser remember his email address. So naturally, I went to his email provider, typed in his email address and did "forgot password". Fulling expecting his security question to be "mothers maiden name", it was. So I logged in to my Facebook and searched his email address. Found his page, look at his relatives, found his mom, and lucky enough, she had maiden name listed. So in a matter of minutes I had complete control of his email account and Facebook account. I never actually changed anything, it was just cool knowing I could.

2921 :: iTunes is 13 years old...and it's still awful
I used to think that it just sucked on Windows until I trial the Mac version and discovered that it was just as bad on either platform
376
2921 :: iTunes is 13 years old...and it's still awful
iTunes was actually pretty great in the beginning. I remember somehow getting a hold of an alpha version for Windows and music management was suddenly easy and fast, compared to using WinAMP.

It had the basic search, song list and playlists. You could rip CDs. Nothing else. Very fast.

Then iTunes Music Store was integrated and it worked OK. But, then iOS devices showed up, and it turned to crap. Then more crap was added. Then even more crap, and now it's a giant, but pretty pile of manure that is this way for a number of reasons. A big hub of disjointed parts that simply don't belong together.

Apple really needs to start over and go back to the basic music management app it was in the beginning and split out the other functions to other parts of the OS.

False. The only time I've ever used it is to try and help my wife a few times when she was stuck. I gave up quickly because seemingly simple tasks were convoluted and extremely non-user friendly. She had to call Apple support to sort it and I refuse to touch it again. It's one of the only programs I've encountered (outside of my work, anyway) where the whole thing made me want to set fire to the universe. Fuck iTunes.

I would very gladly disable adblockers if sites would agree, in return, to not run:

1. Ads that cover up the thing I'm trying to read.
2. Ads that slide out, slide away, slide around, slide anywhere.
3. Ads that quiver, shake, flicker, or vibrate.
4. Phony "loading" pages.
5. Bloated bellies, rotten teeth, or other images chosen to elicit disgust.
6. Poorly-targeted porn ads. (Hey, I look at porn. But I don't like rapey-looking gagging blowjob porn, and I don't want to see ads for it.)

I may be uneducated in the matter but how much is it going to cost every fleet of every aircraft to be scrapped and an entire new fleet bought. That seems pretty damn expensive. Those aircraft are lightly serviced fairly frequently to ensure they last as long as possible. Just seems like 250 billion in savings of fuel is going to be overshadowed by the cost of replacing every plane owned by any remotely major airline.

If advertisers weren't so obnoxious, I would never have installed AdBlocker. And this is coming from someone who didn't install AdBlocker for years based solely on principle. I ***like*** to patronize the sites I go to! 

My grievances:

* **Loud adverts** - *Goddam thing makes me have to turn down the volume every commercial to avoid waking my neighbors at night.*
* **Ads that make you click** - *You hold the show hostage until I click to continue. Again, stop making me get up and operate my mouse. I'm trying to relax and watch a show. I'm a captive audience, that should be enough for you!*
* **Ultra-high video quality ads** - *I can't even enjoy watching your garbage ad because the quality is so high, chances are my internet or my video card can't handle it and it's a stuttering mess!*
78
2906 :: AdBlock Plus has successfully defended itself in court for the second...
One of the things that I think often gets overlooked when talking about ads on the internet is security.

Ad networks are up for sale to the highest bidder, and sometimes those high bidders have the nefarious intentions to compromise the ad networks to attempt to hijack unsuspecting users' browsers and computers.

Your daily routine of catching up on the news at the New York Times could result in a malware infection just because an ad network that the site partners with was not very diligent about vetting out the advertisers.

Ad-Block practically stops this attack vector in its tracks.

I have been using Ad-Block for years, and coupled with a Flash Blocker and not installing Java in my browser, I have been free of Malware for as long as I can remember, barring any particularly stealthy variants that I am unaware of (which is possible).

Using Ad Block is just good security on the internet.

2906 :: AdBlock Plus has successfully defended itself in court for the second...
Good. When content is served to the user in a package, that user should always be free to decide which parts of it are allowed to run on their device, and which ones aren't.

If a content provider wants to offer their content in an "all or nothing" fashion, they already have ways to do so, by only allowing some of it to load once another part (in this case, advertisements) has; there are also different revenue models they can choose, like a subscription one. What they cannot do is limit the ability of users to do whatever they want with the content client-side, once it has been served to them; the time where the user was resourceless and had to swallow everything the way the providers intended to is over, and it's not coming back.
32
2906 :: AdBlock Plus has successfully defended itself in court for the second...
There's a very simple answer for advertisers, embed your ads in the web page. I don't want content coming from third party web sites that I didn't ask for. Stop tracking me so you can decide what ads I'm going to see. Simply put the ads on the site (like television does for TV shows) and let me decide if it's relevant.
29
2906 :: AdBlock Plus has successfully defended itself in court for the second...
I wouldn't block ads at all if they did away with the ads that auto-play.

2906 :: AdBlock Plus has successfully defended itself in court for the second...
When a company has grown to a size that it feels it needs to trap people or use government to to keep the business model growing. It is over or that is it, time to do something else. Adblock keeps things honest.

>Wired reported that last year Kovah and his partner at Legbacore, Corey Kallenberg, exposed firmware vulnerabilities that affected 80 percent of PCs they examined.

>“It turns out almost all of the attacks we found on PCs are also applicable to Macs,” Kovah said at the time.

>Kovah said they looked at six vulnerabilities and found that five of them affected Mac firmware. Their discovery showed that hardware makers tend to all use some of the same firmware code.

>“Most of these firmwares are built from the same reference implementations, so when someone finds a bug in one that affects Lenovo laptops, there’s a really good chance it’s going to affect the Dells and HPs,” said Kovah.

>“What we also found is there is really high likelihood that the vulnerability will also affect Macbooks. Because Apple is using a similar EFI (BIOS) firmware.”

>"We use our research to help raise awareness of firmware attacks, and show customers that they need to hold their vendors accountable for better firmware security,” Kovah told Vice News.

Oh no, if you get an executable on the internet and download it, or plug in unfamiliar hardware, it has the potential to take over your computer! Well umm.... duh?

Going through the comments here and it's all just circlejerking how horrible Apple is, but no one is actually discussing the actual problem. 

>[**Am I vulnerable?**](http://tidbits.com/article/15841)

>Probably not. OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite breaks the proof-of-concept demonstration. That doesn’t mean Macs are immune from firmware attacks, but it does mean the current attack demonstration won’t work on Macs running the latest version of Yosemite.

>**Is there anything I need to do?**

>No, nearly everyone can ignore Thunderstrike 2 entirely. The research really is excellent, compelling work that the Wired piece unfortunately turned into a bit of a fright-fest. The Web attack vector, in particular, is blocked in OS X 10.10.4. The worm can’t automatically jump air gaps — those in sensitive environments can easily protect themselves by being careful where they source their Thunderbolt devices, and this entire family of firmware attacks is likely to become a lot more difficult as hardware improves, and as device manufacturers update their firmware code.


For those who're actually concerned-- this requires physical access and/or root access to be an issue. So don't let random people use your computer or you might be at risk. 

Again, this virus does NOT work on Yosemite, can only connect through Thunderbolt and not USB, and pretty much everyone can ignore the virus in its entirety since it's just a proof-of-concept that hasn't even been demonstrated on Yosemite.

[Here's a better source.](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/judge-forces-apple-help-unlock-san-bernardino-shooter-iphone-n519701) Apple only has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device. FBI will then try to decrypt it, I assume by brute force (would would be easy for a 4-digit PIN).

The interesting part is that the device is owned by Farook's employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. Had they been following proper device protocol, they would already have administrator access to it.

This was literally government property used for terrorism, and now unsearchable not due to the "encryption" boogeyman but their own ineptitude.

2906 :: Judge orders Apple to help the FBI unlock the iPhone of San Bernardin...
From another user:
TL:DR It's physically and practically impossible to break the encryption.

Apple uses a dedicated chip to store and process the encryption. They call this the Secure Enclave. The secure enclave stores a full 256-bit AES encryption key.

Within the secure enclave itself, you have the device's Unique ID (UID) . The only place this information is stored is within the secure enclave. It can't be queried or accessed from any other part of the device or OS. Within the phone's processor you also have the device's Group ID (GID). Both of these numbers combine to create 1/2 of the encryption key. These are numbers that are burned into the silicon, aren't accessible outside of the chips themselves, and aren't recorded anywhere once they are burned into the silicon. Apple doesn't keep records of these numbers. Since these two different pieces of hardware combine together to make 1/2 of the encryption key, you can't separate the secure enclave from it's paired processor.

The second half of the encryption key is generated using a random number generator chip. It creates entropy using the various sensors on the iPhone itself during boot (microphone, accelerometer, camera, etc.) This part of the key is stored within the Secure Enclave as well, where it resides and doesn't leave. This storage is tamper resistant and can't be accessed outside of the encryption system. Even if the UID and GID components of the encryption key are compromised on Apple's end, it still wouldn't be possible to decrypt an iPhone since that's only 1/2 of the key.

The secure enclave is part of an overall hardware based encryption system that completely encrypts all of the user storage. It will only decrypt content if provided with the unlock code. The unlock code itself is entangled with the device's UDID so that all attempts to decrypt the storage must be done on the device itself. You must have all 3 pieces present: The specific secure enclave, the specific processor of the iphone, and the flash memory that you are trying to decrypt. Basically, you can't pull the device apart to attack an individual piece of the encryption or get around parts of the encryption storage process. You can't run the decryption or brute forcing of the unlock code in an emulator. It requires that the actual hardware components are present and can only be done on the specific device itself.

The secure enclave also has hardware enforced time-delays and key-destruction. You can set the phone to wipe the encryption key (and all the data contained on the phone) after 10 failed attempts. If you have the data-wipe turned on, then the secure enclave will nuke the key that it stores after 10 failed attempts, effectively erasing all the data on the device. Whether the device-wipe feature is turned on or not, the secure enclave still has a hardware-enforced delay between attempts at entering the code: Attempts 1-4 have no delay, Attempt 5 has a delay of 1 minute. Attempt 6 has a delay of 5 minutes. Attempts 7 and 8 have a delay of 15 minutes. And attempts 9 or more have a delay of 1 hour. This delay is enforced by the secure enclave and can not be bypassed, even if you completely replace the operating system of the phone itself. If you have a 6-digit pin code, it will take, on average, nearly 6 years to brute-force the code. 4-digit pin will take almost a year. if you have an alpha-numeric password the amount of time required could extend beyond the heat-death of the universe. Key destruction is turned on by default.

Even if you pull the flash storage out of the device, image it, and attempt to get around key destruction that way it won't be successful. The key isn't stored in the flash itself, it's only stored within the secure enclave itself which you can't remove the storage from or image it.

Each boot, the secure enclave creates it's own temporary encryption key, based on it's own UID and random number generator with proper entropy, that it uses to store the full device encryption key in ram. Since the encryption key is also stored in ram encrypted, it can't simply be read out of the system memory by reading the RAM bus.

The only way I can possibly see to potentially unlock the phone without the unlock code is to use an electron microscope to read the encryption key from the secure enclave's own storage. This would take considerable time and expense (likely millions of dollars and several months) to accomplish. This also assumes that the secure enclave chip itself isn't built to be resistant to this kind of attack. The chip could be physically designed such that the very act of exposing the silicon to read it with an electron microscope could itself be destructive.

It comes down to: "Do you want to allow criminals to access your iPhone so that law enforcement can also access a criminal's iPhone?" I certainly don't.

Apple pretty much already controls everything that goes on their phone, and as such are quite a bit ahead of Android when it comes to being able to put out fixes or patches, but totally bypassing the carriers would be awesome for all players. The carriers should be providing apl/gog with access to their environment, not custom coding crap per carrier requiring like 4 different forks of the same software.

2903 :: Study: Google hurting users by skewing search results
Does it not actually make it better for consumers if they don't have to click through to websites? I mean, if 45 percent of the time they google local shops and find what they need on google's own little tab, they won't click through, but they saved themselves a minute or two and some bandwidth. They're claiming this is hurting users... how?

Bad study seems bad?
368
2903 :: Study: Google hurting users by skewing search results
I can't speak for mturk but I have done work on clickworker/uhrs for bing. Basically it would show the results to a query searched in bing on one half of the screen and the google results to the same query on the other half. I was supposed to pick which results I preferred. 

Here's the kicker, they weren't really interested in my opinion. Before starting the work each person had to read through Microsoft's expectations for determining which search engine was better. That meant my preference often went against what Microsoft wanted me to prefer. I was fine with clicking based on their parameters though; I learned what Microsoft wanted and clicked accordingly because they were paying me to. 

That kind of bs and preference manipulation makes me wonder if it happened here too though. I know for a fact that I prefer googles results over going to yelp. While my opinion is easy to write off as simply a member of the dissenting vote, the fact that yelp paid for this research to be done on a website that can easily skew the results in whichever direction they desire should cast a lot of doubt on this study. 

tl/dr: the method of study is dubious

The same points are made in that link as are made in the article.


It's hard to trust a survey bought and paid for by the complaining party itself, I'd attach more trust to it if it was executed by a neutral body. Now there is no guarantee of it being unbiased.

IMO this is just Microsoft & co's subterfuge to restart anti-trust investigations in the US, after successfully snaring Google in Europe.

2903 :: Study: Google hurting users by skewing search results
This is 100% Bullshit.  I get the websites I work on to the top of google (after the paid ads that everyone knows are BS) by being relevant to the search parameters I know my customers will use when looking for the goods and services we promote.

I don't BS or try to "game the system" in any way.  I simply write good, relevent information in my meta descriptions, without a lot of repetition, and keep the sites I build updated regularly.  

I don 't need Yelp with all it's paid ad BS searches trying to userp my carefully crafted copy  appearing above me in google's search results, and I appreciate all the work they do to produce relevant results for the consumers I need my small business client's to reach.  We don't pay google anything to get on the front page of the search, we simply write our copy, and they use it to give the users what they're looking for.  

Yelp is constantly bugging my clients to pay them monthly fees for top placement and for recognition, and most of the small businesses I work with simply can't afford to; they have limited advertizing budgets, and appreciate what google does.

Isn't google completely within its rights to recommend its own products above competitors? Google never claimed to deliver unfiltered search results, your results are influenced by location, advertisement data and I'm sure countless other factors, it's not like this is unusual.

Don't they categorise search results anyway? Who cares if they're giving results from their website database or their business database.

Not suprised in the slightest.

The Freedom Act was basically just a PR stunt to make it look like our government was doing something about PRISM when it didn't change shit.

every technology publication around pointed out how having a public advocate at the FISA court wouldn't mean anything if the court could just go "lol nah" to them.

The collection of the data is unconstitutional at the onset. You cannot collect any peoples "papers" without a warrant "describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

I'm just not sure how you can spin this to be constitutional.

2903 :: Public advocate: FBI’s use of PRISM surveillance data is unconstituti...
I'm sure the way you get on the FISA court in the first place is to be someone whose opinions are that the government's allowed to do this kind of stuff.

We don't go through a public confirmation process for these judges.  They were put there to be a rubber stamp, and that's exactly what they are.

But when there can even be such a thing as a secret court, you know that rights and constitutionality are no longer a priority.

> Under the USA Freedom Act, which established the public advocate program, the advocate may not appeal the judge’s ruling.

This is the only part that really rubs me the wrong way. Well, aside from having an always-secret court in the first place. FISA court judges no doubt take their job seriously, and the judge here even had a reasonable argument for his expansive reading of the statute (of course the question is "is the statute constitutional?"), but they are one judge who comes from a prosecutorial background almost exclusively. Just knowing that some possibility of review exists would affect the work of the court, I would argue positively, and a court whose every decision has serious civil liberty implications in an area of constitutional law that is murky really can't be walled off from the highest court in the land whose job is to say "what the law is."

The other day I was driving in the middle lane of a 3 lane road. I thought something was wrong with my truck, I had the perception I was weaving back and forth. It wasn't me, I just happened to be between two drivers texting. Each came within inches of hitting me. 

Stay safe out there. I guess there's more important things for some people to do than drive while they're driving.

193
2898 :: Google’s Driverless Cars Run Into Problem: Cars With Drivers.Dmitri D...
Reminds me of sights of people being visibly angry at overly cautious drivers or drivers from different states that are more/less aggressive than local drivers.
116
2898 :: Google’s Driverless Cars Run Into Problem: Cars With Drivers.Dmitri D...
I can see some cases where a car can be too cautious, for example, if it would never go while at a 4-stop that's filled with human drivers who never come to a complete stop. But this example seems ridiculous:

> adaptive cruise control [...] drives by the book. It leaves what is considered the safe distance between itself and the car ahead. This also happens to be enough space for a car in an adjoining lane to squeeze into, and [...] they often tried.

This is how I drive, especially in heavy stop and go traffic, I leave a safe amount of space in front of me - I'm at least 2 to 3 second behind the car in front of me (sometimes more in really erratic traffic). And compared to typical drivers it looks ridiculous, many drivers leave a gap of a second or less, but of course a lot of drivers also end up slamming on the brakes when traffic slows unexpectedly too (and occasionally getting in to accidents).

Do people cut in front of me? Yeah, almost constantly, and then ... they cut in front of someone else. They assume that because there's a gap, that my lane is moving faster, but it's not. It's moving the same speed, it's just moving more consistently. The kind of people who jump in to every open spot they see are they same kind of people who are going to jump out at the next opportunity.

And what's the absolute worst case scenario? People keep cutting in front of me, and I have to slow down a little bit? Lets say that on an hour long drive, 20 people jump in front of me, and stay there, which means I have to slow down a little every time. That means that it will take me marginally longer to get off the highway, I'll be about 1000 feet further back in traffic (assuming each car "pushed me back" by 50 feet), it'll take me about 25 seconds more to get to my exit. The entire "inconveince" of being an incredibly safe (and calm and relaxed) driver for an entire *one hour* driver in bumper to bumper traffic is getting off the highway *25 seconds* later, a fraction of a percent slower. And honestly, I've never had 20 people cut in front of me and stay there, for an hour in traffic it would be more like 2 or 3 people.

This is the real problem, not that people aren't driving safely, it's that we're so used to driving aggressively we don't even know what safe driving looks like. People, even experts, dismiss it as insane without even considering the details.

As a security researcher this sort of thing infuriates me. We spend so much time and energy finding ways to protect your data, your communications, your private personal life and then we have an agency that proactively tries to undo all that. 

"But the musleems can use encryption!" So what? You think the US is the only source of cryptowork? AES was developed by two guys from Belgium. When the US had restrictions on cryptography most of the crypto work moved overseas to Canada and Europe. If terrorists want to use encryption they'll be able to always find ways to communicate even if it's by using onetime pads. 

In the meantime, the NSA And other 3 letter agencies stop hardware shipments overseas to install their own backdoors. Brazil and I believe Germany already told Cisco to fuck off.  American products of engineering are being seen as full of spying eyes. The worst part is is not done with National Security in mind; they gather all this intel that is then passed to corporations (such as oil & gas) to know about competing bids for projects overseas. Chevron can undercut BP on a blind bid because they got "tipped" off by some agency that was able to spy the bids.

Oh, man..  I got Windows 95 for my 16th birthday (two weeks after launch).  What a time...  the mid 90s, being a teenager with this whole revolutionary new world emerging.  I mean, MS put a Weezer music video ON THE DISC!  Two years before DVD hit retail in the States.  It was so futuristic and slick and sexy!  Good times.

By 11:00 p.m., people were lined up outside and when we opened the doors at midnight, it was like a geek cult party. I remember that I was able to take a copy home as well as a bonus to working that night from the store manager.

2878 :: The hysteria over Windows 95 launch, 20 years ago
We had a family friend. He used to be married to my aunt. His name was Rod. He looked like a biker. He had a beer gut, thinning hair, and a handle bar mustache. He wore leather vests. He's the kind of guy that had wolf tapestries hanging on his walls. And he was the only person in my childhood who nerded out about computers as hard as I did.

One Saturday when I was 14 he just showed up at my apartment and was all like "Windows 95 is out, let's go." We drove to a mall that had a Office Depot, or CompUSA, or one of those. I don't remember which. We stood in line forever. When we were done he had bought a copy of Win95 for himself and he bought me a copy too. That and a 28.8kb/s modem.

It doesn't seem like a huge deal, but when I was a freshman in high school my parents were divorced and my mom and I were living in a tiny apartment. She served drinks in a Pokerhall. We were poor. I had a Packard Bell computer but it was low end. It had shipped with Win 3.1 and Windows BOB. Between that and the 14.4 modem it came with I spent most of my free 1000 AOL hours waiting for things to load.

Now I'm 33. I have a wife and kids and a good career as a 3D artist that pays my bills. It's cheesy but without Rod's small act of kindness toward a nerdy kid who shared his hobby I might not be where am I today.

Thank you Rod. Thank you for Windows 95.

Cox: the "less shitty" ISP

Fast speeds

their bandwidth cap is more of a suggestion

When I was a miscreant kid who pirated movies and games, they seemed to be rolling their eyes and yawning when they sent the cease and desist letters. I got like six of them over a couple years. The most that happened was internet would be shut off until I called them. All they wanted to hear was *that specific file* was no longer being *accidentally* seeded. Internet back on immediately after call.

I had to leave them for a while. They had a intermittent line problem they could not figure out. Over a couple months they probably spent 100s of man hours trying to fix my issue. I had Cox engineers with collar shirts and ties at my house. They even had someone camp out over night since the issue seemed to happen late evening to around midnight. They didn't charge me a cable bill for 2 months, and were comping me all the premium channels to try to keep me. Unfortunately, I couldn't play any multiplayer game after 9pm due to 5-10 second internet drops several times an hour. 

I left them for Uverse. I could tell you the Uverse stories, but I don't want to slip into depression again. After the contract was up, I went right back to Cox. Luckily whatever the issue was had been fixed.

2878 :: BitTorrent Usage Doesn't Equal Piracy, Cox Tells Court
I'm on Cox and hearing all the horror stories about Comcast and Time Warner makes me so grateful I'm with an ISP that mostly seems... not evil.

I have gotten a couple emails from them warning about complaints for file sharing (oops) but that was a few years ago when I forgot to run a p2p firewal for a few hours. I also got an email from them about exceeding a bandwidth usage limit, which is when I discovered they have a meter. Funny thing is, I've never found a way to increase the "limit" or any stated penalties for exceeding it.

What I like about them the most is that I pay for 60gb (now 100gb) but I always speed test slightly over what I'm paying for.

2853 :: Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go ...
Watching Black play this game was insane! As a low dan player, every one of AlphaGo's moves made me very uncomfortable. Even after seeing Lee Sedol respond brilliantly to parry a lot of them, he still lost by about 6.5. Trading the corner for the center group seemed questionable to me, but I don't think it would've made a difference given the final margin. Thoroughly impressed.
282
2853 :: Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go ...
Yesterday a lot of commentators thought that Lee Sedol made some mistakes that seemed unlikely for him and therefore thought that Lee still has the best chances to win the best of five match. Today the commentator from the advanced stream said that it seems that Lee Sedol played a really good game and his mistakes seemed to be harder to find. Now I wouldn't wonder if AlphaGo wins 5-0 though I do hope that Lee Sedol can make it somehow closer.
111
2853 :: Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go ...

When AlphaGo plays itself, how long does a game take to complete? From watching yesterday's stream it looked like it played at a sort of human pace. I wonder if that is done for politeness or simply thats how long the inter-move calculations and processing take. If its the latter, training it by playing millions of games would have taken some serious parallelism. The kind of compute that only Google, AWS or FB could muster. 
19
2853 :: Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go ...
I was watching the livestream of the event. Was the 'Alphago' essentially BM-ing the human player towards the end of the match? That at least was the sense I got from the commentary, saying that 'Alphago was not checking too vigorously for the next moves' or 'it knows it can win now, hence making unexpected moves' or something along those lines. Or is it just so different we cannot understand their moves? 
I am mentioning this only because, during yesterdays win of Alphago, some posters had mentioned that towards the end of the game, it becomes easier to predict or arrive at the most optimum moves compared to early game.

What I don't see any other comments rendering on is the possibility that this will be a viable meat substitute for an economy without the agricultural base that we have on earth.
On a planet like Mars it isn't viable to consider having a giant herd of cows, but having a reliable protein source that tastes and looks good goes a long way toward solving some fundamental problems with nutrition and psychology. The efficiency of producing this in regards to a 'naturally' cultured meat source is intriguing.

I see this point, but in Kenya they have been using mobile phones to replace cash for years and it has lead to a dramatic decrease of the 'unbanked' population. I don't think they've gone away from cash but it has created more banking like behavior (including savings, budgeting, etc.).

sometimes there can be legitimate non-illegal reasons to want to hide transactions from the government, or just to keep them private.  For example, what one does in the bedroom (and associated purchases that go along with that) is no one's business as long as it is legal.

If everything is cashless, you are no longer in control of your money. One flip of a switch and your account could be frozen. Speak out again the government and "Oh, our mistake. It'll be fixed in a week." or "You're currently under investigation for a crime." and the charges later dropped.

2840 :: Why we should fear a cashless world: Poor people and small businesses...
I personally do not like carrying cash. If I get robbed or lose my wallet .... I just lost all my cash. I prefer credit cards (which I pay off every month). I keep a whopping $20 in my wallet that I practically never have to use. I keep it there just in case I may have to use it. I don't have to stop at my bank or ATM either. In fact... the only times I have to is to deposit the odd check I get paid with from class action lawsuits or money people owe me. 

Cash is nice for wanting to buy things anonymously and not leaving a paper trail, but otherwise.... it is a pain in the balls to get, use and carry around.

2840 :: Why we should fear a cashless world: Poor people and small businesses...
I am glad people are finally waking up to the importance of cash.

Despite its technological shortcomings, cash will always have one advantage over other forms of payments, and that will be its anonymity. Even bitcoin is not completely anonymous as transactions can be associated with pseudonyms, that with some works can be mapped to the people behind them. 

In addition to being resistant to surveillance, cash is also resistant to NIRP - the negative interest rate craziness that central banks are trying to push onto the public. As long as you can store your heard earned cash under the mattress nobody can charge you negative rates for having savings.

This actually fixes the whole chicken and egg problem of 4K adoption. Greater access to 4K content will drive 4K TV sales. This will in turn drive 4K tv prices down and they will become more mainstream. Then this will drive demand for legal 4K content higher.

2841 :: Pirates Can Now Rip 4K Content From Netflix and Amazon
Worked on this sort of technology for many years.

I'm not sure what was preventing this in any complete sense prior - I think they just used "now" because they didn't know it was happening prior.  

Even if you have end-to-end hardware encryption (e.g. Intel MediaVault, with integrated on-chip video decoding and decryption) it inevitably ends up an analog signal for display.  

In the vast majority of cases, the content is decrypted from some source DRM scheme before re-encryption in HDCP for transmission over a display cable (HDMI etc.)

In either case the video is available in full quality at some point, either in the original digital format or as a raw pixel stream.  This is not to over simplify the challenge of efficiently recovering it.

It is much more complex, but same idea as audio.  You can protect audio with DRM and encryption all you want, but at the end of the day the output signal is analog and can be re-recorded during playback with 30+ yr old technology (albeit shittily).

So, all a/v media can be copied, and all the effort that goes into encryption and DRM just makes that task some degree more difficult, but never impossible.

The fact that the content is 4K or 1080p or 480p is irrelevant to the overall topic, aside from technical challenges based on the raw bitrate.

Piracy also happens so that you can get content at lowest quality possible as to not breach your data cap.

Not everyones reason, but some peoples only reason.

Interesting, legally it passes the sniff test. How questionable the actions are I'm on the fence about. It's basically license plate Street View, and your car is in the public space so it seems like a stretch to expect license plate privacy. As the push for police body camera adoption continues it's not out of the question to expect them to be used for data collection as much as if not more so than police accountability.

They were taxed on worthless shares.  In some cases, the tax bills were six fucking figures.

How is this even *legal*?
770
2822 :: When a Unicorn Stumbles... “Employees essentially ended up paying to ...
I've been in silicon valley for decades.  The typical rank and file employee for a startup that has a successful outcome will make about $300,000 on their stock options.  One in ten gets there, there other 9 get nowhere.  If you work 3 years at each one, in 30 years, you'll get that one sweet payout for $300,000.

Some make more, but those are very rare, one company out of a hundred thousand, type of events.

HOWEVER, startups pay lower salaries.  About $3K per month less than you could command at a larger company.  So over that thirty year period to get that one $300,000 payoff, you'll take $3000*360 months or about $1M lower salary.  So you've paid $1M to earn $300,000.  If you only stay 18 months at each one, you'll spend $500,000 to make half the $300,000.  If you only stay 18 months until you find the one that makes it and then stay until all your options vest, you're still losing money.

If you are a fairly early employee, and that company is the one to hit it off, you might make $3M if you stay the whole time.  But starting at that stage has an even higher rate of failure.  So even that once in a blue moon event does not compensate you for the $300,000 loss because the risk outweighs the return.

And don't get me started about the 80 hour work weeks.  Now you've made $3million, but you've given away 5 years of labor at $160,000 (essentially the price of the 40 hours you worked for free) or $800,000 in unpaid overtime, plus the $3K lower salary, at 60 months, or another $180,000.  So you risk $1M for a one in a thousand chance to make $3M.

Startups really don't pay.  You go to them in order to work on cool technology.  The VCs and founders make all the money.  The rank and file employees always lose money working at a startup.  Always.

2822 :: When a Unicorn Stumbles... “Employees essentially ended up paying to ...
And that's why, when employers ask me how I view the equity share of a compensation package, I point blank say that I consider it to be worthless until it has more than paper value. 

Caveat: I'm the kind of tech employee that you bring in either just before or just after a company goes public or is acquired by a larger company. I take the kind of "Fuck it, ship it." work that startups make and get it to the point where it works for the long term. So it's extremely unlikely that I will ever make a ton of money on the stock I might own in a company I was working for. I will make more money by investing my pre-tax dollars in the S&P 500 and being home for dinner every night than I ever will working eighty hours a week for a startup.

There are dozens of companies like this in the Bay Area at the moment. Companies that have little chance of success over the long term. It's just a giant Ponzi scheme; IPO and sell; be acquired by a large monolith and move on before they realize that they've paid for a dud - all while wearing a company issued hoodie.

The employees at these companies know the deal, it's not a secret, it's a gamble, don't feel sorry for them - life in the bubble is wonderful until the pop.

Nick Bostrom (author who Elon Musk and others spoke about earlier this year) talks about a number of possible "existential threats" to humanity including artificial intelligence.  But one of the other threats he mentions is a form of totalitarian lockdown made possible by either a new philosophy or technology.  Earlier in the 20th century people feared communism might be like this - an unkillable state that once entered could not be exited.  Communism didn't turn out to be like that, but Bostrom and others fear that technology driven lockdown via total surveillance and control could be.   

Most people don't want total surveillance and control but can be persuaded to accept incremental steps by seemingly worthy arguments about the need to protect us from terrorism, keep children safe, protect the state from outside forces, etc.  The problem is tough - assholes who abuse freedom by spouting hate can be tolerated if rare but if common, people will demand protection.  The solution that avoids totalitarian control depends on a societal preference for freedom and individual responsible conduct.

I feel like most of these features were mentioned when I installed Windows 10. But maybe my process was different since I used the "media creation" tool.

I would love if instead of an **opt-out** of data collection feature, they'd give us an **opt-in** to data protection feature. Encrypt our data, upload, store. Only the user has the key, only we can access it. Encryption algorithms have made even supercomputers incapable of cracking hashes (say for another few thousand-million years at least), that could easily be implemented into these services.

This is something I seriously don't understand...

All other giant tech companies do the same thing. Google, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, etc have been doing this for years. The biggest difference being that Microsoft is attempting HELP users understand what going on in the background in relatively simple terms and making it easy to customize yourself, whereas the previous norm was to just throw a giant TOS that people blindly accept. Also, Microsoft has been in a constant legal battle with the government trying to PROTECT peoples e-security (in addition to several tech companies)

Literally almost everything people are complaining about are features that require the cloud to work properly, and these are features that people want and use. If people are SO paranoid about an algorithm knowing that you looked at funny cat videos, you honestly shouldn't be using the internet at all...

Fear mongering clickbait title. Almost all modern operating systems send anonymous data, be it Android, IOS, OSX. And peer to peer downloading is a thing in many online games, and it helps to decrease trafic to Microsofts servers, leading to a faster smoother rollout of the new OS.

Beyond security concerns, I really don't want my OS to sell me anything either.  Plus its hard to trust that just by clicking a few built in opt-out options that I've actually stopped MS from gathering my data.  Also its not responsible employees im worried about, its the compiling and storage of my data for who knows how long-probably long enough for some disgruntled asshole of group of assholes or governement of assholes (china, any other other shit government) to raid the servers and steal it all.

Suddenlink cable put in data caps out of nowhere. Within 3 months I switched out to a slower, but uncapped 24mb DSL service. Within 3 months of that, Suddenlink reversed course and now offers a 200/20mbit uncapped line for 60 bucks. From what I gather, a HUGE chunk of their customers switched away and they suddenly pulled their head out of their ass.

This is why I haven't gotten a 4k TV. I know content is scarce now, but when it is more readily available it will be impossible to stream within the caps. 

Don't worry though guys, if I ever find a genie, I'm going to fix this shit. I am fairly confident that is the only way at this point.

I do believe that "we the people" have paid for the cable infrastructure to a large degree, with little to no return on our "investment".  How about an audit to find how the money was spent, and what type of return we received.

It has been amazing to watch the growth of CPU power and speed but I have to wonder if the move away from Moore's Law is more about a shift in priorities of the R&D.  For the last 20 years the extra gains were eaten up by a public wanting tech than can do all the things we dreamed of.  Now we live in a world where the CPU can handle all we want from it but now bandwidth battery life have become the blocks. 

It is a good thing that the field of computing has gotten so broad that people can now move from getting the core up and running to pushing niche areas.

* The client crashes just by clicking things in the interface on Mac and PC.
* Call quality comes and goes as it pleases despite both ends being on solid, stable connections. Even when calling locally on the same network.
* Messages do not sync across devices and notifications are sporadic and often late.
* Group calls often end abruptly for no reason.
* Calling a group doesn't mean that they are not already in a group call. In other words, I can call a group and (despite them already being in that group call) it will call them all again.
* Calling a group doesn't mean that everybody will receive the call, sometimes it just won't bother.
* Skype randomly starts doing "something" over the network that causes massive network usage spikes for prolonged periods of time.
* It can take up to 10 minutes for an online user to appear as online.
* Your account can easily be dictionary/brute forced with no repercussions for the attacker.
* If you're account is hijacked, the hijacker can call their own premium numbers spending hundreds of dollars of credit.
* After the lengthy process of getting your stolen money back, you will never again be able to purchase any skype products as your account will be blacklisted.
* The ads that appear on skype use more CPU than the software itself.
* Calls made using skype are not secure.

Our team has made weekly calls since 2013 on Skype because not all of us have other solutions available. It has been a complete nightmare and it took around 10 minutes per meeting calling, recalling and switching the host around for a stable connection to be made between all of us. There were no particular bad clients or patterns emerging, it was completely random every time. Fortunately, we've recently switched to teamspeak as a solution for our group calls and couldn't be happier.

The software is maintained by sales people who pulled "skype for business" out of their ass which (incredibly) has all the issues mentioned above and more! My personal favourite is the one where a blank group message appears on my screen because after a certain number of recipients, it just gives up sending text and just sends nothing. That bug has been active for around 2 years. They don't give a shit.

As a developer, I see "sending text across networks" next to "hello world" programming tutorials. This is NOT difficult stuff. These are NOT difficult issues to fix. https://www.reddit.com/r/skype - Check it out! Problem after issue after controversy.

The news is probably based on the following (German) articles: [this](http://www.heise.de/security/meldung/Shopshifting-Sicherheitsforscher-decken-Luecken-beim-elektronischen-Bezahlen-auf-3052165.html) and [this](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/shopshifting-hacker-decken-massive-schwachstelle-bei-zahlung-mit-ec-karten-auf-1.2793453). 

Yesterday, there was a talk about it on the 32c3: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7368.html

Roughly speaking, this is not about a credit card system, but about a [german debit card system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cash).

As I understand it, one of the possible hacks is 

1. Buy a used terminal (the ones people put their cards in)
2. Find out some details of the terminal (namely the terminal ID)
3. Now you can create fake transactions because you look to the debit system provider like another shop which has such a terminal and do things like "This customer paid yesterday, but is returning the item today, let's give him back money."

 I'm a certification analyst for one of the largest payment processors in the world and the largest on e-commerce. My job is to ensure that all point of sale devices are compliant with industry security standards as well as best practices.

Credit card fraud mostly affect business owners. The card brands ( Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.) offer fraud protection for the cardholders and holds the merchant responsible for any fraud committed on any card unless it's proven by an investigation that it wasn't.

The credit card terminals are NOT manufactured by banks and every manufacturer must pass certification with any processor. Although it is possible to steal someone's pin number and clone their credit card info this can only be done by stealing the information before it's in the terminal (during the swipe). The terminals and pin pads (which are fully encrypted for debit) do not store full card numbers or pin numbers. Also, on credit cards, the CVD code (three digits on the back of the card) is not in the card's magnetic stripe; the only two places this number resides is printed on the back of the card and in the issuing bank's system, that's why is used for verification of physical possession. No one is allowed to store CVD codes and merchants are held entirely responsible if they do (this happened a few years ago with Sony when credit card data was stolen and they were in violation of credit card processing rules by storing the CVD). 

Now, in Europe, Canada, parts of Asia and South America the standard is to use chip cards (referred in the article as SIM card), these are also known as EMV where "E" stands for Europe. Chip cards offer a level of encryption and transaction verification so high that it is impossible to commit fraud in a 'card present' transaction simply by cloning the magnetic stripe. Each specific terminal must be individually certified and on every transaction the banks and terminals exchange a unique encrypted key to ensure the transaction is coming from a valid terminal and that it is being performed using a real card issued by the bank and not a clone. This verification is done through the chip in the card which is encrypted. The chip itself cannot be cloned with current technology (that I am aware of) because each key exchange that takes place generates a key that is randomly created by the issuing bank every time the terminals connect to run a transaction. This all happens within a fraction of a second and the transaction itself is not sent for approval until the processor and terminals have exchanged the correct keys first.

US is probably the only major country in the world not to use the chip card system, but a federal mandate ruled that all banks and merchants must convert to chip cards by October 1st 2015 which didn't happen because most small business cannot afford he cost of adopting chip cards. Mastercard and Visa charge in excess of USD$10,000 to a merchant to certify for chip cards and the implementation of the technology itself is hindered by this fact and the fact that it's new to the US and there aren't many people in the technical and sales field that understand it. 

If you live in the US, you probably have already received a new card from your bank with electronic connectors that look like a sim card embedded in it.

None of this, of course, applies to online transactions because the card cannot be presented to the merchant physically so address, name, and CVD verification is performed. There are other methods to avoid fraud from happening online such as Verified by Visa and Mastercard Secure Code which work by connecting to your bank and your bank then proceeding to verify your identity by making you log in to your online banking and sometimes by using questions selected from your credit report profile. If you bought from Ticket Master you probably have come across this and the reason not every online merchant has this system, which protects them against charge backs due to fraud, is because is not mandatory and/or it's too expensive to pay for.

Let's get over this whole "not trying to set a precedent" argument. There is no such thing. When a court makes a ruling on a novel matter, that by definition sets precedent. Any future court will look at that ruling and will be expected to make a similar ruling or provide a really good justification for why the original ruling was *wrong*.

Funny how nobody seems to be discussing how the FBI has like a dozen other iPhones for other cases that have zero to do with terrorism they *also* desperately want Apple to provide a modified iOS build for. It is true that they only want the self-destruct code disabled so they can bruteforce the phones' PINs, and not provide a straight-up backdoor, but doing this still reduces the integrity of their entire security model.

It's strange how many people out there don't get why creating a backdoor is a Very, Very Bad Idea™, even if it's ostensibly for a "noble" purpose like ferreting out terrorists.

It's one big Native Ad for apple. as people will say "I'm buying from "good guy" apple. They won't give away my info." But just be aware that whatever happens on a federal level usually trickles down to the local level. So your local police will be able to begin confiscating your phones and having them unlocked to view your life. My car insurance company allows you to pull up your policy on the app and show an officer when pulled over, but I still print out the paper because cops will usually say they need physical possession of the policy and I refuse to hand my phone over.

I worked for those guys before, doing tech support they pushed us to make sales. I had stupendous reviews but lacked any sales, they wanted to make me a sup but I hated the job. The premium boxes they sold broke all the time and we constantly had to roll out techs to recalibrate them so they'd sync up together. Fucking contour sucked dick. I've never lived anywhere that had Cox Cable either. Plus data caps on all their Internet plans, even the gigabit one they offered in ARZ.

The worst part is half the time a tech had to come out because something was broken they charged to fix things. Lots of angry customers yelling at me because of hour hold times meanwhile they're trying to cut down on call centers and going for all the lowest bidders for call centers.

2740 :: Tesla Model S slapped with $15,000 tax surcharge for CO2 emissions in...
Reason: [The govt. did the math wrong on the conversion of watts/mile to watts/k. They multiplied 1.6 instead of divided.](http://electrek.co/2016/03/10/tesla-model-s-singapore-emissions/)
1688
2740 :: Tesla Model S slapped with $15,000 tax surcharge for CO2 emissions in...
Looking at the low end values (worst performance in terms of km/kWh) the Model S gets at least 5km/kWh or 200Wh/km (rated at 5.5 to 5.8km/kWh or 181 to 172 Wh/km).  This leads to a 100g/km CO2 emission level, or half of what they rated it at, dropping it down to an A1 rating and resulting in a rebate not a surcharge.

Basically their bad math turned it from being the equivalent of a Prius to a Landrover. 

*edit*  the rating of 5.8km/kWh (172Wh/km) fits with the bad metric conversion.  444/1.6/1.6= 173.  I would imagine with Elon being in touch with their PM this must have come up.

> "As for all electric vehicles, a grid emission factor of 0.5 g CO2/Wh was also applied to the electric energy consumption. This is to account for CO2 emissions during the electricity generation process, even if there are no tail-pipe emissions. The equivalent CO2 emission of Mr Nguyen’s car was 222g/km, which is in the CEVS surcharge band," the spokesperson added

in singapore gas powered cars are slapped with a 60k tax surcharge. for the tesla it is significantly less... its not exempt from the co2 tax surcharge, apparently.

its a way of keeping traffic down. its also a reason you mostly see taxis and luxury vehicles. (you hardly see budget vehicles, i saw a chevy aveo in singapore and cringed thinking of the co2 tax compared to the vehicle cost)

any singaporeans here to chime in?
14
2740 :: Tesla Model S slapped with $15,000 tax surcharge for CO2 emissions in...
Aside from the unfortunate math error in calculating the tax, it actually makes sense to levy it. The comparison to iPhones made in the article isn't relevant. Nor is it relevant that he already pays his electric bill. The intent of the tax appears to be to discourage release of CO2 for the purpose of driving around. Whether you directly release CO2 by burning something that release it in your car or you indirectly release it by inconveniencing electrons that were excited for you by someone else releasing it, the end result is that you caused x amount of CO2 to be released because you drove a car.
13

I'm not sure I even understand the logic behind this, an explanation would be great if someone could clarify.

For the Tesla, they're tabulating the emissions created on production of electricity used to charge the car?  Rather than the actual emissions produced by the car itself.

Is that common?  Do they perform similar calculations for the shipping/ refining of oil to create gasoline?  The gas stations that let you fill your tank?

It just seems like an awful double-standard to employ, unless I'm actually the clueless one.

Yes, "metadata" is such a slippery term.  

"We only collect metadata about everyone's phone calls."

But "metadata" only means "data about data".  Full text transcriptions of phone calls falls squarely within that definition.  It's data generated (the text transcription) about some other raw data (the audio of the phone call).  This has been my suspicion ever since they admitted to collecting everyone's "metadata".

I can't imagine a plausible security apparatus that didn't do this. How else do you handle the volume of data? It has to be converted into text to be parsed and searchable, otherwise it's not accessible, and therefore useless. 

It's logic and common sense from top to bottom, and it's been available since at least before the room 641a leaks, and probably in other versions or stages of development and reach before that.

Likely, the internet itself was a trojan horse, and AOL disks were likely the key in the door.

Just assume that any sort of data collection, has been going on since it was technically possible.

and never take a spy agency's word for anything, given the nature of their intended function.

the only way to refute any claim about the behaviour of such an agency is full transparency, which would mean a severe hampering of their basic function, to collect data, parse it and use it for XYZ purpose.

There's a couple of differences. DMCA can basically strike at any content hosted on a server that happens to exist in a country that has certain treaties with the USA. So, with YouTube, since the content exists in CDN's for fast delivery worldwide, you could make the argument that the content is being hosted in a country that has to allow DMCA takedowns. Taking it off the CDN, of course, affects everywhere. If the content was hosted by a subsidiary of Google that operated only in a country that didn't have to comply with DMCA takedown requests, Google could easily ignore that request.

Though it likely wouldn't. The ability of the US Government to cause problems for Google is infinitely greater than the ability of the French government. Google could completely pull out of France and it would barely notice. The French, however, would notice right away. Google doesn't have the money, time, or infrastructure to pull out of the good ol' US of A. 

Furthermore, Google doesn't delist things from searching because of DMCA. For example, you can google thepiratebay, isohunt, and various other torrenting websites. The MPAA has put ridiculous amounts of legal pressure on governments to deal with ThePirateBay. That hasn't stopped it from being searchable.

Why on earth would someone go back to cassette?  Chromium 8-track I could understand... but cassette?  Where the tape stretches over time, the heads continually degrade performance, and there's cross-talk between the four tracks (because you flip the tape over so the left channel playing one direction is right next to the left channel playing the other direction.

8-track was OK; reel-to-reel was OK; the cassette, which I used right up into the late-90's, was the kind of experience that DivX (the disc format, not the compression format) was attempting to reproduce.  There's a good reason it was scrapped early on.

The reasons people are getting into cassettes are different than the reasons people got into vinyl again. a) Cassettes are cheap to make. If you're a diy punk band these are an easy way to make a small buck. b) They're more so fun objects to have to remember a band by than something to listen to music from. I don't think you'll find a single person claiming cassettes are better, audio quality wise, but there is an experience, both aesthetic and memetic that goes into playing (or just purchasing and owning) a cassette.

This article is talking out of its ass. There is a sharing program that installs a proxy on localhost. These links to 127.0.0.1:4001 are actual filesharing links, and Universal is asking Google to take them down.

Not to be a wet blanket, but isn't it more likely the program used to query traffic has a copy of the same file? 127.0.0.1 isn't an "internal server" but the actual computer.

Why would a legitimate news outlet think that the company itself sends out those notices? And because they know they don't, why would they talk about servers that have no connection or play in the process of the generation of those notices?

It says right in the notice

This just shows that most of those takedown serving services are run by idiots who managed to create or get their hands on a few tools that automate the process.

Quote from one of the comments in the article:

> I had to register just because this article is so very very wrong and it needed to be called out.

> First: The list the IP was on had nothing to do with torrents and seeding. It was a list of websites that are hosting copies of the movie that they do not want google to link to. This is an entirely different means of piracy than torrents and seeding.

> Second: The IP is not for an "internal server" somewhere inside universal it is for the very computer that is being used.

> Third: There are services that work by installing a piece of software on your computer, then having a URL like this (remember, right back at your own computer) call up that software and use arguments (the stuff at the end of the website address) to point it at the right place in the outside world.

> That is what happened here. They crawled the internet, got one of those URLs, and then did not notice it before they sent it to google.

> No copy on their server, nothing to do with torrents at all. **Every conclusion in the article is incorrect clickbait at best, a blatant lie for clickbait at worst, and terrible "journalism" regardless**.

Why does everyone and this article assume it means the movie was hosted on their own system? 127.0.0.1 always means localhost. You think they searched their own computer and came up with that link? No. 

They likely found that link in a web page somewhere, by searching for the torrent on Google. It doesn't mean much.

Nooo, it's being hosted on the computer that's finding it.

That's not only an internal IP, it's *the* computer that's searching for it and a local link to itself.  It's not able to be seen through DNS outside of that link.

The problem with these tires that is hard to overcome from an engineering perspective, is that they execute poorly when forces are applied sideways as when skidding. So this doesn't make them very reliable or safe for extreme situations.

So... What if we put an outer layer of the tyre that's flexible like this, but kep a traditional pneumatic inner layer? 

Wouldn't that soften the ride and at the same time significantly mitigate the puncture risk by distancing the pneumatic section from the outside world? You could include a framework of the solid tyre around the inner pneumatic core that only forms structure if the inside is deflated - giving them endurance even if they do get a puncture.

It is under Freedom of Panorama, this is when you are allowed to take photos of buildings designed by other people.

2685 :: EU Moves To Create Internet Fast Lanes, Pretends It's Net Neutrality ...
I used to think that we in the EU have a good sense that net neutrality is important, and even with sensible traffic prioritisation (think QOS), the overall direction seemed ok.

the newest development however, may not be.

I am all for regulation in the mobile market to curb the excessive pricing models, especially with roaming charges.

However, sneaking the very definition of not-neutral in the text and calling it net neutrality is very very troubling.
we should not take it and make it clear (like the US citizens did) that we demand an open and neutral internet.

and even if they honestly want that too, the wording chosen is not sufficient to guarantee that. I never ever want to see or hear "fast lanes" again, this is bullshit and never will result in a better experience for the customers!


258
2685 :: EU Moves To Create Internet Fast Lanes, Pretends It's Net Neutrality ...
Some people seem not to really understand what's happening.

First, this decision is not supported by every EU country. I know for sure the Netherlands voted against.

Secondly, we are here talking about minimum rules for EU members. Every EU member is free to employ stricter laws. Which again the Netherlands has already done.

Also remember, this is just a political deal. The EU commision and parliament were for stricter rules. The EU council (where EU member states are represented by the responsible minister of the matter at hand) was against.

This is just a case of give and take. This doesn't mean that separate EU countries won't implement stricter rules on their own.
26
2685 :: EU Moves To Create Internet Fast Lanes, Pretends It's Net Neutrality ...
That sounds like something we already have here in Ireland, HEAnet, it's an entirely other internet dedicated to the higher education system, with unbelievably fast high quality speeds and it's own closed off security.

I don't see the link between the opinions in the article and the cited text, but then again the citations didn't mention what the exact definition of "Internet services" is, or what prioritising means, or what constitutes "high-quality" Internet. 
6
2685 :: EU Moves To Create Internet Fast Lanes, Pretends It's Net Neutrality ...
Don't ISPs and trunk providers around the world already do this with QoS?  Our existing internet routers and bridges already prioritize things like VoIP, NTP, probably BGP messages, etc.  Right?
5
2685 :: EU Moves To Create Internet Fast Lanes, Pretends It's Net Neutrality ...
I'm not sure why the article acts like the EU doesn't match what the US did. The US rules allow fast lanes with restrictions also.

Regulators in both countries see that there are certain latency and reliability sensitive operations which may need to be treated differently.

It is important not to kill innovation with regulations. And the regulators are being sensitive to this and trying to split the difference. Is it really necessary to assume that any rules which can produce a bad outcome will produce a bad outcome and that the rules can never be changed?

This is the same argument used against socialized medicine in the US. That it will be abused and yet people will become addicted to it so it cannot be altered (or repealed) to fix this. Being fatalistic like this just seems like analysis paralysis.

I'm all for innovation of technology.  I think the application of hydrogen in a vehicle is the wrong direction for this technology, but it's innovation that may help other scenarios in the future.  So I say bring it on for innovation sake.

2676 :: [energy] Honda unveils hydrogen powered car; 400 mile range, 3 minute...
The problems I have with this are the same ones I have with current ICE vehicles:

They are tied to a specific fuel source. If that fuel source becomes non viable, it's a bitch to transition millions of in use vehicles. 

They don't benefit from scale efficiencies. A power plant is much better at getting power from fossil fuels than a typical car. 

Going electric takes care of both. (While suffering its own issues)  Electric vehicles give zero shits *how* the power is generated. This pushes the decision of fuel source up the chain to more efficient large scale plants. Maybe they're nuclear, coal, geothermal, whatever. Doesn't matter. We can change our generation tech without having to go though a massive consumer transition. 

Being fuel source agnostic is key to future flexibility.

I think Top Gear had a segment a few years ago where they predicted that hydrogen fuel cells would be the future.

The main problem they pointed to with electric cars, was the charge time. A three minute fill up is a vast improvement over charging up all night.

People are saying that the average commute is so small that the charge time is not a problem for most people. But I would suggest that there is just something phsychological about having a full tank of fuel. People like thinking they can just drive 500 miles.

This price tracks the average amount a typical "identity abuser" (the thief steals the identity and sells it to the "abuser" who milks it for money) is able to get out of a typical stolen identity. The lower the price the better. A low price means it is hard to milk the stolen identity for money. If security were perfect (a "stolen" identity was impossible to abuse) this price would be $0.00 because nobody would want to buy useless stolen identities.

IT Security Guy here.

Yep, that's why malware is how it is. Targeting individual people is a sucker's game. The professionals are trying to cast as large a net as possible, and then they sell the lot.

That's why it's so important to have an up to date and comprehensive security posture. Every day, thousands of variants get pumped out of malicious software outfits to bypass known malware signatures, increasing the likelihood that 'Common Sense' Bob or 'I let my subscription expire, lol whatevs' Sally getting a discrete threat in their system that funnels their identifiable information back to some server in russia or china (statistically speaking).

Sure, you sell one identity to some dude off ebay, maybe he gets a credit card and racks up a thousand bucks of charges before it gets caught and sorted. But what if you had 10,000 legitimate addresses, phone numbers, and SSNs? You just got a whole lot of very convincing masks to put on a bot network; you could be selling twitter followers, youtube clicks, focus group data..  Not everyone is mindful enough to ask how things are done, just that results are obtained.

The modern world of cyber-crime is almost as out of public view as the modern world of ultra rich tax havens and money laundering. Just because the news doesn't report on it often, doesn't mean that there isn't a thriving community out there, getting business done.. laws be damned.

This is not surprising at all.

Your ID's and CC information has most likely already been stolen multiple times, there's just so many on the market that it's more a matter of luck if you specifically get targetted.    After things like the target hack and several others there's literally millions upon millions of CC numbers out there, some of the hacker groups were mad as it has depressed the cost of credit card information so much.   

The end users will usually buy a few hundred to thousand at a time and just go through them until they find a user that fits their profile for what they need to do and use it.

This is what I've been saying from the beginning.

The industry leaders of technology can't even keep their services clean of illegal bullshit. Anyone with a lick of experience in information analytics could have told you that we're *still* struggling with how to store and process "Big Data".

I don't pretend to know all the goings on between the government and tech giants, but I certainly haven't heard of the better engineers in the industry being secreted away into classified government projects. I work in IT, so even if I'm not actively checking job postings, I know a lot of people that are; and there just isn't any sign of massive hiring initiatives coming from the government for the IT necessary to make mass surveillance useful.

It's difficult to keep a project that big completely under wraps unless you're dramatically under staffing.

This is the top comment from the CBC site (not my comment - IANAO) - can any optometrists chime in?

> As an optometrist in BC this is really a cool advancement. However, a few things weren't mentioned or really made clear. This is a type of multifocal lens which already exists today and typically run about $4000. It is also a procedure called a clear lens extraction or CLE which many laser eye centers already perform. The point is to remove your natural lens in the eye and replace it with a powered implant. Typically they implant only a lens with distance power still requiring reading glasses for up close. This type of muliifocal lens has also been used in cataract surgeries to provide people with clear distance, intermediate and near vision although they have been less than impressive. I'm excited to see if this will be an advancement in that area. Secondly, 3x better than 20/20 is a bit misleading. 3x worse than 20/20 isn't 20/60 as the the eye chart units don'y increase and decrease linearly . So 3x better than 20/20 may only be 20/15, still better though. Also, the claim that you will see better "no matter how crummy your eyes are" is also grossly misleading. It is true if you have no other diseases of the eye such as corneal scarring, glaucoma, optic nerve damage, a lazy eye, retinal detachments, eye turns or macular degeneration. All these diseases can lead to a loss of transmission from the eye too the brain that is the nerve fibers are lost.If there is a loss of cortical connections then no lens implant will make your vision any sharper. This will work best for adults who have no other eye disease. Finally, there are the risk involved with the surgery such as retinal detachments, infections and inflammation to name a few. I am excited to see what advancements this brings though.

I had 20/10 vision up until about 2 years ago, now it's 20/20 and that shit is fucking blurry.  My eye doc literally called me a cry baby. (with a wink)

He understands what I am missing but he told me I now have "normal" vision and I was like "fuck me, really?".

The bottom line is many of you have no idea how extra sharp vision is a plus in life.

Think of it this way:

20/10 is HD 1080P

20/20 is 480

Am I the only one that finds this incredibly dangerous?

Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, etc, quickly discovered that they could never win the battle on topics like net neutrality as long as the internet, in general, was against them. The uproar from various online sites ultimately turned into a massive wave of aversion towards the FCC's initial proposals (which allowed "fast" lanes), which eventually led to a complete overhaul of the plans by Wheeler and the FCC, with the final result being the preservation of net neutrality. 

Now, it seems these companies are taking a different approach - taking control of the narrative. And they seem to be doing this by taking control of the very sites that publish news and tech stories that conflict with their interests. Verizon already purchased AOL, which means they now control the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Engadget. If Comcast goes through with these deals, they will have control over Buzzfeed, Re/code, and The Verge. These six sites make up a significant portion of the online technology publishing community, and now they'll all be owned and controlled by old media and the ISPs. 

My hope is that the editors and writers from many of these sites start to leave and form new tech sites, free from the control of the ISPs. I wouldn't be surprised if, a year or two from now, these sites start publishing articles with titles like, "As the internet continues to evolve, so must our views on net neutrality."

Dear Mister Comcast,

How are you? I am fine. I ate a cookie last night and it was good. Do you like cookies? My teacher gave me two stars on the picture of a bus that I drew but it was supposed to be a hotdog with ants on it.

I have heard that you are giving millions of dollars to your critics. I would like a million dollars. If I say you are a bad person, will you give me a million dollars?

Please write back soon and please remember to send me a million dollars.

Your friend,

Ramses

Fuck these sites. Comcast gets all the hate but what about these sites whose traffic was built by their unwavering coverage of SOPA, CISPA, and net neutrality? Almost of all of which heavily linked on reddit bringing them tens of thousands of page views per day, no doubt? People trust(ed) them to be places they could go for honest, critical pieces on the attempts by the ISPs to exert even more control over the internet. It's not like the money is being forced on them. Oh no, poor TechCrunch getting bought out. 

Fuck that they could have said no to the money but its less a question of if you have morals but more "how much do your morals cost?"

2629 :: Toshiba fakes $1.2 Billion in profit, CEO resigns
[I'm late here, should have posted earlier but busy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobashi_scheme)

This once was pretty common in Japan, or at least this has happened before. I work in finance and will explain a little.

It is called a tobashi scheme. [The most famous recent one deals with Olympus.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_scandal)

It's kind of like Japan's Enron, if it happened more than once and continues to happen.

So they realize they have taken a lose on the books. They then take the lose off the books by selling the bad assets to shell corporations. They then purchase these corporations and spend an insane amount on lawyers and consultants for the purchases. The corruption required is with consultants, auditors, c-suite, and the board( which in Japan the CEO is often heading the board)

Not sure if this applies , but it might

2629 :: Toshiba fakes $1.2 Billion in profit, CEO resigns
Somewhere around 13-15 years ago Toshiba released a Palm Pilot competitor. I can't remember the name. But I believe it had some numbers in it. 

This thing was the bees knees. It was a touch screen PDA, game station, had external storage iirc, and even played mp3s. I think it even had wifi but would only connect through WAP enabled websites. Preteen me thought this was huge. A computer in your pocket that could do everything! 

Well after two weeks the screen broke after a tiny drop from the top of my pc tower to a carpeted floor. I was pissed. 

Got tossed around to different call centres around the globe, nobody took me serious because of my age and because I couldn't get their accents. Took a week of phoning to get a box shipped to send it back for repair. 

90 bucks and 6 weeks later and it's back. Finally I can live my dream of carrying a computer with me everywhere. I unbox it and to my utter dismay the screen didn't work. They either didn't fix it properly or it was damaged in shipping. I raged.

Phoned those condescending jerks in some other country and explained what happened. They refused to own up to their screw up and demanded I pay again. They sent me a new box to ship it off to them but I refused to pay the bill twice. My Dad felt bad and offered to call to ream them out for me. I said not to worry. That I'll just never buy a Toshiba product again in my life. 

I'm proud to say I held firm on that and haven't given them another dime. 

Fuck you Toshiba. You're all a bunch of crooks and I hope your business dies a quick and painful death filled with class action lawsuits and felony charges. Fuckers.

2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees
Mom, we got you a modem so you don't have to pay rental fees. Rental fees. Yes you do, it's right here on your bill. Yes. No, that's not for the TV. It's for the modem. The blinking box under the desk upstairs. No, the black one. No, that's not the CPU. That's the modem. You're renting that. Yes. Here's one I bought. It's cheaper. I'm just going to switch them real quick.   
Yes, the internet did stop working. I unplugged the modem. It will come right back up. Yes I'm sure. No, you don't need to call Time Warner. Give it a minute. There, it's working. No, it's not slower than it was before. No, it's not.     
I'm going to take this one back, now, so they don't keep charging you a rental fee. Yes, the TV will still work when this is gone. Yes, the microwave will still work. Test them if you don't believe me. No, they will not stop working if I take the modem away. The modem is unplugged, there is no possible way it is maintaining the functionality of your kitchen appliances via proximity.      

And then a week later I get a phone call because the internet stopped working, only to find she'd unplugged the modem and put it in a closet because ever since I switched the modem she keeps getting spam.

2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees
Just be sure to watch your bill. Comcast started charging me for modem rental twice over the course of a year even though I had never rented a modem from them. One of the times they insisted that it was in fact a rental. Got it straightened out, but it was a pain.

2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees
I bought my own modem a year ago march, so I've had my own modem for 16 months. I was being charged $8/mo. 

All was well and good until this July when Comcast notified me they "forgot" to charge me rent, $10/mo modem rental fee started last month.

I went in to speak with customer service, showed them the receipt for their modem I turned in. My Comcast bill shows a $10 balance owing. Crossing my fingers that it gets cleared up in this month's bill. Not hopeful.

Here's what Charter pulled on me:

I had a Arris SB5141 modem that I bought from Best Buy to use with my Charter internet. Was using it for about 1 1/2 years to save myself the $8 fee then my price went up. I called for the any promotions which they offered me $39.99 a month and the rep told me that covers the modem fee. I advised them I have my own modem so it should be cheaper but they told me if I use my own model the plan will be $60 a month....blows my mind. Forced to use there modem they send me the SB6141 which is pretty much the same modem far as specs. Dirty scumbags!
39
2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees

2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees
Got my own modem several years ago. At one point it stopped working and I had to spend an hour with support to get it enabled again. They kept saying they could not find it although it had been working fine up to that point. Had to be patient and keep them on the line until they straightened it out. 

I have a feeling if enough people start doing this that they will charge a "convenience" fee for using our own modems.
11
2623 :: Fight back against your ISP: Stop paying bogus modem rental fees
Also watch your bills. A couple of years ago our ISP tried adding  the 'leased modem' fee to the bill. I hadn't looked at the bill for a few month and was just paying the fee. This was for a modem I knew I purchased. I may have leased a modem when I very first got cable in like 2001. I just had no proof of purchase for my modem. It was time upgrade modem anyway so I immediately purchased a new modem and got rid of that fee. Funny they didn't ask for the modem back. Mediacom.

Boggles my mind to think that anyone did not know that the alphabet soup gang was using private planes to do business. There is no real difference in the data collection and the tailing of Henry Hill.

None of this stuff is new, the Fed has always used wiretaps, bugs,  spies, and all of the other information gathering techniques and technologies available. how on earth would you not expect them to be using the newest and best technology available.

I don't know what the answer is anymore. It used to be thought that the government is on the side of the american people. Certainly not as prevalent an opinion any more. Again and again the government shores up the corporate structure while undermining the common mans freedoms.

This has been public knowledge [for more than a decade](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-03-17-fbi-planes_x.htm). (article from 12 years ago) Stories like that have appeared in public newspapers all over the country.

Somehow that fact got left at the station when the hype train pulled out last week with headlines trumpeting the "discovery" of a "secret" program. Is it surprising there are politicians (and journalists) who are uninformed about FBI activities so public they could have been briefed on them simply by picking up a newspaper sometime in the last 12 years? Maybe. Sadly probably not.

I think OP of this particular story just timed his repost perfectly to tap into the anti-surveilence conversation that was already going on that week. It went viral, and as always happens, nobody bothered to check if it was accurate before forwarding it up the content conveyor.

2611 :: Verizon Wireless selling data cap exemptions to content providers
This is a bad trend and a backdoor to circumvent net neutrality rules.  Mobile data companies will systematically increase the cost of data on a per bit basis forcing consumers to use "sponsored" or "exempted" content. You'd think content providers would join together to oppose this, but it might be strategically beneficial for larger content providers to get aboard and solidify their positions so there are strong anti-cabal incentives.

>Growth hormones, food and agricultural nanotechnology, endocrine disrupting chemicals, antimicrobial resistance to anti-biotics, plant synthetic biology and so many others. Nothing about them -- among other controversial food safety, and animal, plant and environmental health issues or technologies -- appears in the SPS chapter. Instead, the chapter describes administrative procedures and consultative arrangements for resolving SPS "issues" insofar as they might impede agricultural trade.

Well, no shit. The whole point of the TPP is to create the mutually accepted mechanisms by which to determine whether something is harmful. If it is, it can be banned. If it's not, then it can't be.

I don't get why this article is getting in a huff, the whole chapter is basically making sure that states can't use bogus SPS protectionism - "you can't import that because it will destroy our ecosystem!!" or "hormones are dangerous", even though there's no scientific backing for it and it's just done to protect domestic industries, whislt allowing them to institute bans and measures *if* there's a reasonable level of scientific evidence that something is harmful.

And no, that's not a nebulous way of defining it. The EU banned US hormone-fed beef imports and lost the US case against it. The EU was given time by the WTO to conduct the studies necessary to prove that hormone fed beef is harmful - the EU couldn't come up with anything, they were just doing it to protect French farmers. The fact is that there's a sweet middle ground between the daily "5 shocking things you didn't know could kill you!" listing mundane and banal things like oranges or steak, and literally drinking DMT flavoured orange juice.

Which kind of explains why it's phrased like that by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy - it's a think tank purposefully set up to promote agricultural protectionism.

So - food health policies can never be "science-based". 

Doing the right thing *always* conflicts with maximum profit. That's why our world is such a shithole even with the high tech we have - every entity in the world, be it corporate or private or even a state - is chasing profit, not the right thing. A competition-based world has incentives that are abhorrent pretty much across the board if viewed objectively.

TPP appears to want to make doing the abhorrent thing the law. Until now, the laws have been used to go against the capitalistic incentives and try to temper the horror. Now, we're making the horror the law. 

Basically, if we're stupid enough to allow this, we deserve what we get.

2594 :: Yahoo's Marissa Mayer gets $55M to leave
This reminds me of the whole Microsoft / Nokia business. Nokia needed a CEO, and they decided on Stephen Elop from Microsoft.  During his tenure, the stock price tumbled, and he decided to make Nokia a Windows only platform. 

A few years after he started, and after the stock price drop, Microsoft bought Nokia. It was later made public that his contract had a gigantic parachute should Nokia be bought out. 

The key thing about that, is it became clear that the company (board of directors) will bonus you on what they want to happen, even if that thing appears to be negative. 

Now, from the article:   

>The potential payout would also be triggered by a "change of control," which includes the sale of the company, according to the filing.

The people on the board of directors that are complaining about Mayer's comp are the same ones that (a) rejected an offer that from Microsoft for $15B beyond current market value of the company, and (b) brought in an "invest and grow" CEO, despite the fact that the board had no clear idea of how that could happen. 

Now they're pinning the failures resulting from the lack of strategy going back 8 years on the current CEO. 

This is the CEO they wanted. This is the contract they agreed to. Bad decision?  Yeah. But only the latest in nearly a decade's worth of bad decisions. 

And the activist investors who weren't around for these bad decisions can also eat a box of dicks. They clearly knew what Yahoo's situation was when they invested. It's been at negative value (barring the Alibaba investment) for two years. You don't get to complain about executive comp packages now.

2594 :: Yahoo's Marissa Mayer gets $55M to leave
I don't understand why these massive payouts to CEOs and executives actually help the company and the economy as a whole. 

First, they're just putting incentives on failure.  Win or lose, the CEO still gets a golden parachute, and they don't need to work again or worry about the health of the company that their decisions have an effect on years down the road.  

Second, these CEOs say that their high salary is necessary because their mind and skill set make the uniquely better than an average person.  I could believe that for maybe a handful of CEOs but not the majority.  Most companies eventually fail, and often times what do the CEOs do with the large of money?  They stash it away and then eventually donate most of it to charity in their later years.  That sucks, because one could argue that the vast amount of wealth they accumulated would have been better off going toward the employees of the company, because that would have given them incentives to work harder and use the money to contribute to the economy. 

Someone with $52 million isn't going to contribute to the economy by buying hundred of cars or eating out at thousands of restaurants.  When they do donate, you could argue that their donations are going to problems that that they arguably contributed to (poverty, nutrition, crime, etc..).

Research in this area is global and growing fast, but lacks standard tools. By sharing what we believe to be one of the best machine learning toolboxes in the world, we hope to create an open standard for exchanging research ideas and putting machine learning in products.

An artificial neural net is more the sum of it's training data than the specific tweaks and optimisations in it's code. I'm not sure how useful this will be to other people without access to Google's vast training libraries.

This is pretty neat, I was reading the smart reply feature they wrote about just [recently](http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.ke/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html) but they didn't really explain how it all worked. Hopefully with this move, we can expect to see some analysis on what's happening under the hood.

>One notable change to Tesla’s Autopilot software is that it’s more safety-oriented, which is to say that **Autosteer is now “restricted on residential roads and roads without a center divider.”** This change of course stems from Tesla Model S owners pushing their Autopilot software to the limit and uploading harrowing videos of their experiments to YouTube.

>As a result, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the following during a November conference call: “There’s been some fairly crazy videos on YouTube… this is not good. And we will be putting some additional constraints on when autopilot can be activated to minimize the possibility of people doing crazy things with it.”

So it's only available on highways now, because people were making crazy, harrowing videos of using it on small residential streets? Is there a typo there or am I reading that right?

>But the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals didn't buy Google's argument. It held that the technical specifications Google had copied — including the names of functions (such as "max" for the maximum function), as well as what type of data these functions accept and return (like the fact that "max" takes two integers and returns an integer) — was eligible for copyright protection.


Really? Oracle holds the copyright to a "max" function? I probably don't understand how this all works, but can't they now sue Microsoft too, as excel uses a max function in probably an identical way to the Java function?

So what if Google don't copy the Java API, but instead simply refer to the Java documentation, and then just document whatever changes they have made? 


Androids Dalvik can run Java programs, but that's not exactly a copy of the API, it's more a translation process that understands Java pretty well.


They could even specify a slightly different syntax, but keep compatibility with Java syntax as a typo compensating feature.


Unless the opinion of the court is that it is illegal to try to understand something?


We desperately need a precedence that allows making things compatible, including the use of patents that do nothing more than mathematically describe a structure or format, as is the case with compression, storage and protocols.


This decision is not really worse than what the rules for copyright and patents are, it's exactly according to those rules at least as I understand them,  it's not really the court that made a mistake, but the rules that if taken literally are outright crazy,

2566 :: Bill Gates calls for a tripling of US Government funding for basic re...
Somewhere between a half and two thirds of modern pharmaceutical research is done by the public sector. Public R&D has given us the internet, nuclear energy, and the general purpose computer. Nearly every major science discovery of the past few centuries has been publicly funded. You can't take the enormous risks necessary for major discoveries without the leviathan insurance only a state can provide.

Gates has it right, we need to put more funding into govt research. We currently put out the most patents and research per capita, but our share is decreasing with relation to the other leaders of the developed world.

EDIT: I've been corrected, we don't have the most patents/research per capita. The U.K. does(you Brits are amazing). We do still have the largest gross though.

Lots of people are mistaking this quote and not reading the article. The private sector is generally inept *at basic research*.

Basic research needs a remarkably altruistic attitude to funding and an understanding management to work. That doesn't mesh in the modern sector. If you cannot tell someone *what* you will discover and *how much money* it will make, they won't fund your work. No major discovery in the 20th century would be possible without funding risks, and we are already seeing a slowdown.
53
2566 :: Bill Gates calls for a tripling of US Government funding for basic re...
Difference is the private sector is funding for answers to problems, the government sector is looking for issues that will garner it more power and screw the answers.

“Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields… ,” Eisenhower warned. “Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.”

While continuing to respect discovery and scientific research, he said, “We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.”

~~ President Eisenhower, 1961

Still true.

It's a no-brainer. You know what *actually* made America great? Our public works. Our highways, our military, our space program that landed on the fucking moon! These are publicly funded, government managed projects which have changed the course of history. ^^^^FUCK ^^^^YEAH

Government has worked in the past! It has historically been the corporations that have explicitly lied about dangers to the public to earn money. Tobacco, Pharmaceuticals, Energy... These motherfuckers will cut corners and exploit systems to the extent of *killing an ecosystem*, and then they'll fucking do it against because "that's how you do business".

By turning capitalism into a religion, we have let businesses get away with some of the most psychopathic behavior in recent history. We were plunged into an economic depression, and effectively no one was punished. Deepwater Horizon devastated coastal communities and countless wildlife, and the fines levied at BP were comically insufficient. 

It's time to bring back government funded research, so we can continue to lead by being a nation of innovators and creators; a country that inspires and helps to improve the rest of the world.

Hmmmm, I wonder what sector stands to benefit from this influx of cash into R&D. They will contract projects with the funds, which means more money in taxes to monitor how our taxes are spent. I agree with principle, but not the method, especially since he started a company whose products have helped the world immensely become a better place thanks to the free market. 

While we are on the subject, I work at a large government contractor and we really need to redefine how the government contracts it work. We had uneducated military NCOs monitoring MIT graduates and PH.D. s and trying to tell them how their specs *should be* done with our MIT guys painfully trying to explain why it was either not feasible, not economical, or not efficient, or had major design impacts farther on in the D/B process.

I've been using duck duck go as my primary search engine for some time now on both my computer, phone, and tablet. I really like the ! searches (!w for wikipedia, !r for reddit, !yt for youtube, !t for thesaurus, !d for dictionary, etc). I think it's a feature not found in other search engines. I also like the fact that it doesn't track. When you do a lot of repeated searches with google, it adds more and more to your URL to keep track of what you've searched that session.

EDIT: It appears that Google no longer makes really long url's when searching.

2564 :: Private search engine DuckDuckGo grows 70% in 2015
Good, Google results have been pissing me off the last year or so when it prioritizes popular results over what I typed in, going so far as to omit very important key words in my search to show popular results giving me useless results. Also removing search modifiers. When I only put in 3 keywords, you can't just remove the keyword with the least hits and expect to show me what I want. Nor do I want the first 1/2 of my search page to be all advertisement results and then show those exact same results again as normal search results.

2563 :: Amazon overtakes Walmart as world's most valuable retailer
I buy a lot of things for my job, I spent 165k a year on your avg home goods last year. I think my Amazon bill last year was around 75k.

You can't beat prime, but in terms of price walmart is always equal and it's free shipping most of the time. It's not 2 day shipping but it often times doesn't matter and they often show up early. 

I prefer amazons site and reviews, but both sites tick me off because they limit quantities. Example I need 30 flash lights, Amazon limited me to 5, so I ordered 6 times. These were not on a special deal or anything. Same applies to RG59 cable. Walmart won't let me buy the store out of drano value packs. 

Beside toner, Costco has both sites beat but they have a more limited selection. 

Wayfair, ebay and overstock are all worthless. Uline is expensive but love their selection and customer service. Wayfair tracks what you do, if you go on their site, 5 minutes later they call you asking if you need help. Too 1984 for me. 

What I don't like about Amazon is when I have a problem and call they don't exactly roll out the red carpet for a guy who just spent 75k with your company!!!!!!!! They don't know I'm a business, I use my personal card and get miles. On paper I look like a rich guy but I'm really your avg middle class dude. Turns out if you want to be treated like a rich guy, you need to drop more than 75k a year on Amazon. :(

Forgot to mention, my credit card companies don't like me. I rack up miles and go on free vacations, never once incurring interest. I called up Barclays after my free vacation, I said I would like to cancel, they said why, I said I used my miles, up, 7 seconds later my account was closed. They didn't try and save me what so ever. Cap one is about to get smoked for a few grand soon for a free vacation, suckers!

There's a big point here that gets lost in the Apple vs Android circlejerk.  Yes, the top phones are similarly priced, but it's the extras that make Apple their fortune.

Flagship Androids generally have 32GB internal storage and SD slots.  For the phones that don't take SD (notably the Droid Turbo and Samsung Galaxy S6) there are virtually free cloud services, most of which come with your subscription to any major carrier.  With octa-core processors and 16+ MP cameras standard, it could be that these big fat Android flagships are more expensive to produce than their apple counterparts and have a longer service life. 

Meanwhile, customers feel rather insecure buying a 16GB iPhone 6, which the conspiracy theorist in me says is by design.  The alternative, which many take, is to shell out $100 to get the 64GB model.  I'm conjecturing here, but that's got to be at least $80 in Apple's pocket.

How much of the increase between the 6 and 6 plus is pure profit margin as well?  You get a bigger screen and bigger battery, the hardware is pretty much exactly the same.  Another $80 in Apple's pocket.

I'm not sure from reading the article if these numbers take into account the crushing disparity in sales of paid apps and extras.  Better devs flock to the Apple market because there are more people willing to pay.  Apple users truly believe that they need Apple chargers and accessories.  

It's kind of a weird cycle in that there's more money in Apple, therefore Apple brings in more money.  100% of the kids who have parents dumb/rich enough to throw away money on gems in freemium games have iPhones because their friends do and they want to facetime.

Then there's the junk phone market.  If you replace the battery and root the dang thing you can make 3 and 4 year androids perform at a level that the iPhone 4 and 4s just won't. 

With replaceable batteries and gigantic processors, expect the S5 and G3 to be around and kicking long after the iPhone 5 thru 5s have become unusable.  Virtually all iPhone users will want a new phone after 2 years, and they're becoming wary of buying the already obsolete version for "free" on a 2yr contract.  Old iPhones get recycled or donated.  Old androids are still in service, which means android (once again) is competing with itself.

**tl;dr Apple is going to be seen as the "premium" for years to come, regardless of how much of it is smoke and mirrors.  As such, they will get more money out of their customers, most of it on the back end and through semi-planned obsolescence.**

You can get underground at Purdue and they have a huge network of tunnels.  They lead to very sensitive areas.  Partial smasher, nuclear research, government research.

Or maybe the fbi should be more concerned about Purdue not being concerned.  Hey Purdue junior rangers...report that shit if you really "care".   When I was at Purdue it was easy to get down there.

Something that's drilled into anyone who has access to classified information is that even if it's leaked, it's still classified and will be treated the same as any other classified information. Doesn't matter what it is, the political implications of it, the reasoning behind releasing it, or whether or not the whole world already knows. Everyone involved in safeguarding classified stuff still has to do their job as normal. The information in question being SCI takes it to a whole new level. Most people would have been arrested at this point.

A friend worked for the state department (employee not contractor). Her job was sorting out visa problems and training personnel. She was really scared that she might accidentally see some of the TS material leaked by Snowden and others as she was warned that it might compromise her job.

The problem is that universities are about open discussion.

Ok so we had the 2nd Dawn or Doom conference. The guest speaker spoke about the Snowden leaks, items which are still classified. The conference was being live streamed and recorded to be released later to the public. Purdue has dealt a lot with classified material being a major research university, a NASA data back up site and has a nuclear reactor underneath the EE building. We have to work a lot with the DoD and as such when a speaker talks about something that is still classified they have to determine if they can officially release the recordings. They weren't sure and decided to delete the recordings to be on the safe side. Purdue has come out and already admitted they went to far. We are now trying to recover the recordings.

The university has to be cautious with this stuff, many people are working on pretty sensitive stuff here. We are also going to be building a massive aerospace research park and have partnered with Rolls Royce. We aren't going to risk pissing the DoD or NSA or any of the other alphabet agencies so we can keep doing the level of research we do. Generally though the uni is very good at protecting freedom of speech, hell we have the crazy hellfire preachers here and do nothing to remove them (as much as I wish we could). 

The man was able to speak at an open event and was  not stopped. No, freedom of speech was not suppressed  in this case. The university owned the recording and since classified material was being talked about, they deleted it to be on the safe side. The recordings are now trying to be recovered.  

Now please stfu about how this is so horrible, suppressing freedom of speech and all that other BS. The university makes the decisions they do in order to try to keep all parties happy and in this case they ACCIDENTALLY went too far, it's that simple.

2526 :: Work Hard, Live Well | The research is clear: beyond ~40–50 hours per...
Been saying this for years. We need to figure out how to alter our society to make the standard work day 6 hours. Most fields don't benefit from having an employee work more than that anyway. Attention spans and energy just don't provide for quality work beyond that point. Not to mention the personal benefits. 2 more hours a day to handle chores, errands, spend time with family/friends, pursue hobbies and interests, take college classes. You wouldn't even need to take a lunch. You could just go to work, get your shit done, then leave without taking more than one or two 15 minute breaks.

I know I'll get the people saying "well back in the day people worked 12 hours a day". I'm fully aware of that, but that's just a horrible argument. A couple hundred years ago you could legally challenge someone to a duel and kill them if you felt insulted. Who cares what USED to be. Saying change shouldn't happen because things are already better is just asking for stagnation.

Obviously there are some fields that would absolutely need employees to log more than 6 hours a day. In those cases it should either be voluntary or those jobs should pay higher wages. It's not like this is a race to the finish and when you're on your deathbed you get more Heaven Points the more hours of your life you spent at work. YOLO. Do you really want the forefront memory of your life to be the countless hours you spent in front of a computer screen or stapling documents or digging ditches?

Obviously I'm aware this kind of change probably isn't going to happen in our lifetimes and we'll be part of the many generations that died knowing we spent the majority of our lives at work. I'm just wishful thinking.

This has the hallmarks of a trap. I live in Massachusetts, and as far as  I know, we did not jump on the touchscreen voting wagon 10+ years ago. My city uses optical scanners where we connect the end points of an arrow to vote for a candidate. No hanging chads, no half-filled bubbles. The votes are counted electronically, but there are paper ballots which can be counted by hand if necessary.  It is not connected to th Internet, th results are printed out and phoned in. It seems like a pretty damn good system, why change it to something less reliable and easier to hack?
34
2510 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election
Seriously, what is wrong with pen and paper?

First of all, have a look here: [Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI)

Let me give you a German perspective to this problem.
The German constitution has five requirements for federal elections:

1. *General.*
This means that there is no discrimination. Every citizen (over 18) is allowed to vote.

2. *Direct.*
No man in the middle, who then votes for you.

3. *Free.*
It is you free choice who you are voting for.

4. *Equal.*
Every vote counts the same.

5. *Secret.*
Nobody knows what you have voted for.

The election for the US president fulfils at most one of them (secret).
Generality is not given, because if you live in the territories, e.g. Puerto Rico, you are not allowed to vote. Direct and equal are not given because of the electoral college and the number of votes per state.
Last, with voting machines, you cannot assume free votes. They are way to easy to manipulate and it is impossible to verify the procedure. You just have to trust what the machine says.

In context of voting machines, the German Federal Constitutional Court set the requirement that essential parts of the election must be verifiable by everybody without any special knowledge. This is impossible  with voting machines.

This brings me back to my original question: What is wrong with pen and paper? 
92
2510 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election
You mean "updated for vote flipping" machines right. They are not updated because the people winning the elections want to keep winning the elections.
14
2510 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election
Machines are fine, even if they are out-dated and defective, so long as we have two publicly-facing registries, allowing us to catch our mistakes and cheats:

One with every vote result, and an associated serial number for each.

One with the names, birth dates, and cities of every person that votes.

Voters are given the serial number as soon as they cast.

All votes can thereby be counted independently and verified for accuracy by anyone and everyone.

(Still waiting on my Nobel Prize for this one...)
28
2510 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election
Didn't this idea of outdated voting machines get us into the mess with non-verifiable electronic voting?

Let's figure out what we need instead of just jumping into buying new equipment because the old equipment is old.

2510 :: 43 States Will Be Using Outdated Voting Machines in 2016 Election
I don't see why they can't have a paper ballot with a black marker. Fill in one option per segment and scan the ballot in a machine. You get to electronically submit the results and have the advantage of a paper trail.

2508 :: New Reddit CEO Says He Won’t Reverse Pao’s Moves After Her Exit
By reversing Pao's moves, they're talking about lifting the ban of /r/fatpeoplehate and rehiring Victoria right?

Huffman has made it clear that he's making changes. Specifically changes regarding shadowbanning and alerting users when they are banned or content gets removed. In regards to Victoria, there was obviously reasons they fired her that we don't know about. Reddit is not obligated to give us specific details. Nor are they required to listen to the community when they say they want Victoria back even though the community has no idea why she was even fired in the first place. But Steve Huffman has been CEO for two days. Why don't we wait until we pull out the pitchforks? This is the problem with Reddit sometimes. People are just SO reactionary...

So how many people actually read the article and/or the AMA? The article says *some* of the decisions made by Pao. *Some* decisions won't be reversed. 

The use of Victoria was more symbolic by the Mods in addressing their frustrations with Reddit's communication and support. Just because she's not being hired back by the new boss doesn't mean he's handling it all the same exact way. 

Reddit's hive mind moves swiftly and is filled with judgement.

91

The result is an electrode that gives more than three times the capacity of graphite (1.2 Ah/g) at a normal charging rate, Li says. At very fast charging rates (six minutes to full charge), the capacity is still 0.66 Ah/g after 500 cycles.

From the MIT article. So actually 3x capacity along with better battery longevity.

4
2513 :: Forgetful scientists accidentally quadruple lithium-ion battery lifespan
It's nice to see these battery breakthroughs, but unfortunately, there is a triumvirate that makes a battery ideal. The triumvirate is life cycle (which this battery certainly improves), energy density (which this battery also improves), and the final piece is cost and commercial viability. This article makes no mention about cost or safety of the battery, although it does say that this battery is easy to scale up. I suspect that an nanoparticle aluminium anode soaked in sulfuric acid and titanium oxysuplphate mix is not cheaper than a synthetic graphite anode that is found in many lithium ion batteries today. No matter how much this technology is mass produced or how much technological advancements make it cheaper, most likely, this battery will never be on the same cost level as the current graphite anode batteries. A more promising, but slightly less exciting (because it isn't a brand new idea) alternative is a silicon anode, which might fit the triumvirate of an ideal battery.

Good luck with blaming the Hospital for not making this more clear. Blame your customers.
159
2496 :: Medical Equipment Crashes During Heart Procedure Because of Antivirus...
Healthcare Sys Admin here. Support many many different clinical applications, Merge Hemo included. Thought I'd throw up a quick response to some of the most frequently asked questions here.

Q: Why not keep a device like this off the network?

A:  Storage, Compliance and Interoperability. Most imaging systems, including cardiac imaging systems, run at extremely high resolutions and dozens of shots are taken. A single case can hit the GB mark easily making it almost a necessity to offload that to external storage, the most automated method being network storage. Additionally, the cases would need to be stored on encrypted media if stored externally. The compliance piece requires that you have long term storage for something like this as it becomes part of the patient's official medical record. And, if it's part of the medical record, that makes it electronic, meaning you want it to cross automatically into that medical record via a network interface. This article is light on details so there's no telling how large an organization we're dealing with here. 

Q:  Why not harden the application against AV scans?

A:  $$$. Clinical applications are few and far between and those that are in stay in. They own the space and there's little to no incentive to make a better product. These applications are developed as cheaply as possible providing the most clinical features but sacrificing technical compatibility in most cases. Additionally, clinical applications require FDA approval before release. Merge Hemo is one of the outliers in that is actually ALLOWS AV to even be installed in the first place. So many other applications or devices won't allow AV, encryption or OS patching, citing the need to get the app / device completely recertified by the FDA (again, $$$). Of course this is an extremely flimsy excuse as it's complete nonsense, but the vendor usually has the upper hand in these arguments.

Q:  Why not use (Not Windows) for this type of work?

A:  $$$. Most healthcare organizations run Windows exclusively for any number of reasons and supporting a Linux environment and application is not something they want to pay for. And no, Open Source is generally not an option. Of course for every case like this there's three other cases where the vendor provides the solution top to bottom - modality (imaging device such as MRI or CT), client and server. All you provide is storage. You get no access, the vendor provides complete support, and the OS is some flavor of SUSE, RHEL, CentOS, take your pick.

All told, yes, the healthcare system should have exempted the Merge Hemo folder from AV scans. This is clearly outlined in the documentation. Of course the representative should have NEVER said that Merge Hemo requires exemption from AV scans, only that the AV product was not configured to their requirements.
24
2496 :: Medical Equipment Crashes During Heart Procedure Because of Antivirus...
Let's be clear: This was a failure of the hospital's IT team.

Having worked for an enterprise AV vendor, standard practice when configuring security on hardware that interacts with patients is to suspend all scheduled maintenance tasks (including scans) outside of an approve window (which is usually 3AM to avoid being at a time during normally scheduled procedures).

Regardless of the third-party vendors involved, the on-site IT staff should be testing all configurations of supported hardware/software *before* it enters production. The crash may explicitly be due to poor coding, but the fact it crashed on a patient is 100% due to poor testing.

The telemetry that Microsoft now uses to improve the operating system will be used to improve ad targeting and the challenges to privacy that we currently experience online will expand to the desktop. I'm afraid that people have become  desensitized to advertising and tracking.

As long as their wallpaper quality without wording I dont care. Most of the wallpaper they've shown have been really good so far for me. I actually looked up a few of the creators etc.

If they do ever go full blown ad then i'll disable it. Otherwise move to Win10 Enterprise.

2482 :: "A majority of Americans say they support warrantless government surv...
The key part is "Only a third of Americans under 30, but nearly two-thirds 30 and older, support warrantless surveillance."

It's very easy to support something that doesn't really effect you. Most of the 30+ people I know basically use the Internet for emails, Facebook, cat videos and other casual uses.

Why would someone who doesn't use the Internet for any real personal activities care of the governments is watching?

They aren't on Instagram, snapchat, tinder, etc. They don't use the Internet in the same way under 30s do. If the government searches a teens phone they basically know 95% of that persons life right there and then. They keep everything on there. 

People make fun of how much under 30s use their phones and the Internet to talk to their friends and forget how private those conversations can be. Unlike conversations that happen in real life or over the phone, a record is kept of every text or post made. Even if they delete everything or use a service that wipes each message after 10seconds, it doesn't help anything if the government is sucking it all up to their data banks (unless it's encrypted).

Several Comcast markets in the US have 300 G cap with an overage fee..Relying on the ignorance of mainstream users..(Most users have no idea what a gigabyte IS, and they certainly have no idea how much bandwidth they're using..let alone how much their Netflix movie is using.)Thanks techies for continually harping on this issue...
30
2472 :: Comcast Admits Broadband Usage Caps Are A Cash Grab, Not An Engineeri...
To all the people thinking media is twisting this story, let me explain. The engineer said he manages the measurement systems and that this is business politics. This means that caps ARE NOT used for data management or bandwidth management as that is what he handles. This is not even remotely twisting his words, this is outright him saying caps are not used by the engineering and bandwidth management side, it is all politics (ie for money only).

Twisting what he said would sound more like "Comcast employee admits that comcast is overcharging you on your bill and owes you money."

25
2472 :: Comcast Admits Broadband Usage Caps Are A Cash Grab, Not An Engineeri...
(Disclosure: I posted this on /r/Atlanta, but it's relevant here)

Data caps honestly make Atlanta (or any city with the data cap "trial") a less desirable place to live, if I were a politician (that didn't receive campaign contributions from Comcast) I would be asking Comcast why they're imposing data caps in our area vs. other parts of the country. I'm originally from the Northeast (New Jersey) and up there they have Optimum, Time Warner and Verizon FiOS - do any of these providers have data caps? Absolutely not.

We live in a world of cloud computing, high definition video streaming and cloud storage/backups are the norms. Modern households can very easily approach and exceed 300GB of monthly usage. Power users can easily use double that - those people should NOT be forced into business class service.

Internet speed is becoming more and more important for daily life. Speed empowers human innovation, and by imposing these data caps, Comcast is potentially stifling said innovation. The next big tech innovator could be living here and putting a chokehold on his or her internet will ensure that he or she doesn't invent the next Google.

BTW - /u/jlivingood is truly an awesome guy, his team is probably the only good part of Comcast.

Just because the attack originated in China DOES NOT mean the attack was by the Chinese government. The large amount of unsecured computers in China makes it a great place to route attacks from.

Bonus for tweaking the amount so that if your jurisdiction has something like a small claims court, you can take it there and the issuer of the claim is unlikely to turn up or defend themselves.

AH64D Apache weapons/avionics tech from 2003-2011: this is a fairly common thing for military aircraft. The nightvision sights (TADS and PNVS) for the Apache quite often needed to be "rebooted", as did electronic countermeasure systems like the APR-39 Radar Warning system. Many times faults found on the ground during pre-flights could be cleared by doing an HPSM (High Power Switching Module - basically a big circuit breaker panel) reset... basically turning the power off and back on.

I'm no fan of the F35, but this is not a problem specific to this aircraft.

Reminds me of the Patriot missile system, which in early 1991 kept time by counting 10ths of a second, storing the number in a 24-bit register. After about 8 hours, the time would become inaccurate because of truncation necessary to store the (now larger than 24 bits) time measurement, and grow increasingly so the longer the system was powered on. As a mobile system, it was assumed that the system would be shut off, moved, and turned back on fairly regularly.

*EDIT: Upon re-reading an article, it seems that it wasn't because the time was stored in a 24-bit register, but that when performing time vs velocity calculations, the system had to convert the time measurement from an integer to a real number, using a 24-bit register that had to truncate, losing accuracy - approximately 0.000000095 per 10th of a second that the machine had been on. Since this machine was on for 100 hours, 0.000000095×100×60×60×10=0.34 seconds drift)*

Unfortunately, the soldiers in Dahran, Saudi Arabia on Feb 25, 1991, were unaware of this issue, and their Patriot Missile Battery had been running for over 100 hours when it detected an incoming SCUD missile. With its time calculation now off by .34 seconds, it looked in the wrong area when tracking the incoming missile, and was off by over 600 meters. The Scud missile struck a barracks, killing 28 soldiers and injuring nearly 100 others.

A software update had been created, but wouldn't arrive until the next day. Though I can't find the link at the moment, I remember reading that soldiers had been instructed to "reboot" the system every so often, but weren't told how often that meant. (Every 8 hours would have prevented any errors too large).

2455 :: A behind the scenes look at how Bitcoin Core developers are holding t...
The situation is pretty ironic.

Bitcoin started out as a censorship-resistant digital currency with decentralized administration.

But now we are at a point, where the vast majority of the Bitcoin network runs on the software of a small, arrogant group of people who dream of becoming the new PayPal. With $76m in funding and the will to take Bitcoin away from users and replace it with their services.

And the subreddit called "Bitcoin" is censored to a degree that is unimaginable on any other subreddit. Everybody who mentions alternative implementations of Bitcoin gets banned. Mentions of uncensored Bitcoin subreddits like r/btc and r/bitcoin_classic get shadowbanned immidiately. Votes are hidden. Threads get sorted so that mentions of alternatives get buried. The subreddit delivers 72kb of customized CSS to manipulate which comments are shown.

It will be interesting to see if they get away with it. I don't think so. You can fool some people sometimes. But not all the people all the time.
1011
2455 :: A behind the scenes look at how Bitcoin Core developers are holding t...
Basically, the team that has branded themselves the Bitcoin Core developers is using inaction to force Bitcoin to change from a peer-to-peer electronic cash that everyone can use to a settlement layer used by institutions.

They're doing this by refusing to remove a temporary limit on the number of transactions that can be made on the system, which will result in a fee market.  (It currently costs a small fee to make transactions, but with the artificial limit in place, that fee will rise until normal ordinary people are priced out.)

There is a conspiracy theory that, since many of the "core" developers work for (or started) a company that aims to profit from offchain transactions, they have a vested interest in keeping people off Bitcoin and on whatever they come up with to scale transactions on a network they've artificially limited to 240 transactions per minute.  Personally I believe most have good intentions and this conspiracy is baseless.

However, they are obviously working against the original spirit of Bitcoin as it was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who envisioned a peer to peer electronic cash that anyone could use.

And the censorship on r/Bitcoin doesn't do their arguments any favors.  Banning users with opinions other than their own, or those who even mention competing ideas about Bitcoin is just disgraceful.
183
2455 :: A behind the scenes look at how Bitcoin Core developers are holding t...
Let's remember who the two most influential persons in Blockstream/Core are:

- A guy who ignored Satoshi's email, because he didn't think Bitcoin would work, and only showed up in 2013 (4 years later) when Satoshi was long gone.
- A guy who believed to have proven mathematically that Bitcoin was impossible. And as it turned out later, the proof wasn't even his. He just stole it. Oh and somehow he managed to get some power as a Wikipedia mod or something, and he vandalized it (years before Bitcoin even existed). Wikipedia contributors and users hated him, but they were helpless, so he even mocked them. 

And we are supposed to listen to these guys when they say that scaling Bitcoin is impossible.

Then move to the alternatives.

Wasn't Litecoin created so that in the event of a Bitcoin failure, a stable alternative is available?

And the Cryptonote coins have managed to implement what a lot of people thought Bitcoin was good for (but turned out to not be so true) - *truly* anonymous transactions (using ring signatures).  AND they have adaptive/dynamic block sizes - which puts to bed all of the 1MB vs 2MB block size arguments.  And Monero is working towards anonymizing the transaction amounts as well (RingCT).

This is the Open Source of currency.  If you don't like what's happening with one project, try a different one.  There's no point in all of this bellyaching when viable alternatives exist.

We have Dish Internet without cable TV. Our speeds are about 4G. For $90 we get 50GB anytime and 50GB between 2AM and 8AM off-peak. We do have to ration our television usage, but the only other option is DSL which isn't much faster than Dish and slows down because we are at the end of the line. (This is typical in Maine I think)

Watch out for beureaucrats and elected officials attempting to brand encryption software as "dangerous" and "a threat to national security." Encryption is no more dangerous than having a private one-on-one conversation in your living room. U.S. Citizens should expect that their communications are private, whether they be in their own living room, or across the street, or across the country, or yes, even across the globe. The real danger is handing the keys over to government employees that can intercept all of our communications and use it however they wish. Imagine an abusive ex-husband tracking his ex-wife's activities. Imagine an enterprising investor front-running trades or selling market information on the side. We're trusting the government with our private information, but the government is made up of individuals who are prone to mistakes and capable of evil acts just like anyone else in the world.

Somehow this is the most shocking to me. We've known for a while that AT&T and the NSA have been in cahoots domestically, but to help tap UN headquarters, even if they are in NYC, is unbelievable.

I would need to read the paper to be sure, but from what I gathered a simpler SEO explanation hasn't been given. 

With the Snowden leaks each and every media outlet started publishing reports on those topic. That means that the Google SERPs of relevant keywords started to be clogged by relevant articles and editorial contents that displaced Wikipedia entries from the first positions. I've done my share of editorial SEO stuff during the last few years and I've seen that happen many times for even smaller events.

A more meaningful way of testing this would have been to have a similar sampling of entries from another topic to test against the key group. Maybe that's in the paper, we'll see when it's out. Still, the numbers are consistent with the fluctuation of positioning in Google results.

Most of the systems in question are for special equipment and not connected to the Internet - most of its networked systems that use the Internet are all on Windows 7 already.

Also, the military prefers reliability so if it isn't broken, they'd rather not spend the money rewriting software and going through lengthy (and thus costly $$) certification processes just to say they have the latest and greatest - hence why you have radios in the military today still in use that were designed in the 70's. 

Same with avionics and planes - the average age of the Air Force fleet is over 27 years old, roughly the same age as the people maintaining those planes! People are surprised to hear that they still use VCR and cassette tapes on a lot of those systems... for the planes that can accept them.

If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, and you had company data on it... It's needs to be wiped. Just make sure you do backups and you are fine.

If the treaty is so wonderful and now that the negotiations have concluded, why is the final text still classified? Why is the American public still being kept in the dark regarding what exactly what we're going to be subjected to? "You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide", works both ways regarding things not directly involved with national security, and this is trade, not of a military and/or covert nature, or at least it shouldn't be. Those with firsthand knowledge can tout the virtues of TPP all they want, but until the details are made public, it's all just unsubstaniated rhetoric and soothsaying.

I can totally understand why they would negotiate this deal in secret and not release terms until it is signed. 

The 24/7 media cycle would go into a frenzy and people without the background or expertise to understand the agreement would be sniping at it from every angle. Then because we would be losing support at home we get populist opinion to decide what goes in the treaty and we lose out on opportunity for economic growth and the lowering of barriers to trade because some fucktards are losing their minds over people "taking their jerbs."

Do I agree with everything they are putting in there? No! However, thinking that Joe Schmo reading this agreement and giving us his opinion would help is laughable.

We need to wait until the full text is brought out and significant analysis is done before we start losing our minds.

“As with so many other surveillance technologies that were originally created for the military and intelligence community, they eventually trickle down to local law enforcement who start using them without seeking the approval of legislators – and, in many cases, keeping the courts in the dark too,” said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union.

2353 :: Early iPhone 6S owners reporting burning hot Touch ID buttons
You mass produce a device you're bound to have a few batches of faulty devices.  Luckily with Apple all you have to do is pop in the store or call/chat in and you'll have your problem fixed.  Especially with this being so early on, they're usually actively looking to capture faulty phones to figure out what exactly went wrong and where--obviously replacing the device in the process.

2353 :: Early iPhone 6S owners reporting burning hot Touch ID buttons
I'm really starting to hate that nobody ever tries to gauge the scale/rate of a defect. If Apple sells 30 million phones, and 0,01% of these have the same defect you still get a flood of 3 thousand of people complaining about the same defect. 

Then a competitor launches a phone where you have a much higher 1% chance of getting the same defect, but they sold 300K, and then they get 3 thousand people complaining as well.

I know it is hard to gauge the rates at which a defect pops up, but I feel it is highly relevant information here. With cars you almost always have relevant statistics about certain failures or defects.

I love the "PO Box is the answer to everything" response to this. Which is ironically another, crappier, form of a proxy. It also happens to be a response that also does absolutely nothing to protect your phone number or email address.

Further, a persistent nutter intent on meeting you is going to figure out what post office that PO box is in and wait for you.

I'd rather a nutter show up at WhoisGuard's physical Panama office, robocall their phones, and spam up their email... instead of my personal one which has far fewer resources to handle the mess. Because I'm not Google. Which means I can't have an office of people solely handling that mess, like the people at the WhoisGuard service can.

MarkMonitor also represents the same industries that opposed SOPA.

The proposal cited does NOT propose prohibiting sites engaged in commercial activity be prohibited from using privacy protection services for their WHOIS data. Read it and see for yourself.

This rule change will only apply to some gTLDs, not all TLDs. Some TLD do not publish any registrant contact information (including `gov`), and this rule change will not change that at all.

What would happen if we forced everyone who started a business or purchased property to put their personal information online?  That would be absurd.  This is the same thing.  In fact, the reverse should be put in place - private registration should be a requirement and not an option.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I got a rather cryptic email from ICAN over the weekend reminding me about the policy regarding keeping your information true and correct or something odd like that. I always use private registration services to protect my users, not just for my sake but to prevent small operations from being called/emailed/harassed by spammers. That ICAN would force them to publicly list their details is shameful to say the least and theoretically, they might even be able to sue me for breach of privacy in the UK, since they did not agree to share their details.

I suppose I could try complaining to the ICO?

I believe that you can use the address of your business, or an authorized agent (Lawyer), in the same manner used with Articles of Incorporation, which are a matter of public record.

The takeaway is that you will need a mailing address associated with your domain, so you can receive complaints, legal service, and assorted other communication.

This said, -DO NOT EVER- use a residential address. Get a P.O. Box, a mail slot at one of the post box rental places, or something similar.

Immediately fired up 1password to check similar logins: I had like 40 (ah the good ole days…), changed the most sensitive immediately: on amazon I had the same simple password from the first time I subscribed, and I thought I had changed it to a more secure. 

TL;DR get 1Password or similar and use it at its full potential.

"Unethical and immoral"

So serving malware to users, tracking the traffic of users in an opt-out rather than opt-in way, and using up people's data caps with Comcast and other capping ISPs to display distracting and quite frankly annoying content isn't?

Look, I get it. Advertisements give content producers money. Without ads, stuff would likely be paywalled, and that sucks. At the same time, though, you can advertise without being intrusive and annoying about it (hence ABP's "non-intrusive ads" program). 

I would also argue that I have a right to decide what gets loaded on to my computer as well as when and how it gets loaded. It's why I switched to Linux shortly after Windows 10 came out, and it's why I use uBlock Origin + uMatrix.

2338 :: TIL about AT&T's new "Unlimited" plan: Probably around $410/month for...
Hopefully I can provide some insight as an AT&T employee. The cost for the base plan of talk/text/data is $60/month and each smartphone line access runs at $40/month. Therefore the first line would cost you $100/month and each additional line is $40/month. A total of 4 lines on the unlimited data plan will cost you $220/month until the promotional bill credit kicks in within 2-3 billing cycles. Once the bill credit applies, four lines will cost you $180/month. Keep in mind that this does NOT include the cost of device installments and you are required to have either DirecTV or AT&T U-Verse TV in order to qualify for the unlimited data plan.

2338 :: TIL about AT&T's new "Unlimited" plan: Probably around $410/month for...
I think people get confused by throttling vs. unlimited.  Throttling just lowers your available maximum bitrate (AMBR) during periods of congestion, yet you still pass traffic.  Traffic falls into two classes; guaranteed bitrate or non-guaranteed bitrate. It is just as it sounds,  non-guaranteed bitrate uses AMBR to establish the peak data rate while guaranteed bitrate negotiates a minimum datarate.  Data uses non-gbr while VoLTE,(VoIP) or video uses GBR quality class of service identifiers (qci).  Gbr is synonomous with real-time services.  During the subscriber attach process, customers establish a bearer (think tunnel) with a negotiated end-to-end class of service which includes AMBR values, retention priority, policies for rating, etc.  After the attach, they might spawn child tunnels requesting GBR to do VoLTE, etc.  Policies might include prepaid volume quotas or rating rules for differentiated billing like zero-rating.  During periods of extreme congestion where packet loss may occur, the mobility network can signal reductions for in-service bearers to ensure high priority traffic (guaranteed bitrate or E911) can still function or that the network itself doesn't overload.  There are finite resources on the towers on the radio interface.  You may have your AMBR lowered, but you are still passing packets.  Later mobility standards (LTE) support 75+ megabits per second AMBR for most non-gbr bearers or tunnels.

Unlimited implies you can pass traffic instead of being blocked once an assigned quota has been exhausted by your online charging service (OCS).  Prepaid folks might get a redirect to a top off to add more data.  Some carrier implementations might lower the subscriber's default AMBR if they are blowing past tiers of data on their plan if they are postpaid or not real-time billed.

OP either can't do math or can't read. Source: I am an AT&T expert at Best Buy and 5 lines is $220, even with installment billing it would be around $320.

$220 5 lines Unl Data (4th line Free)
$108.35 =21.67X5 (a $650 phone install plan)
$41.99 DTV Select Package

Total Cost $370.34

You also have to take into account that prior to installment billed phones this family would pay $1150 every two years for subsidized phones but with this plan they're included. That's a savings of $47.92 a month.

Real cost compared to old two year contracts is $322.42.

If you didn't purchase phones but brought your own it would be $261.99.

OP you're only $148.01 off.

Just keep in mind that the DirecTV pricing typically increases after the first line would cost you $220/month until the promotional bill credit applies, four lines will cost you $220/month until the promotional bill credit of $40/month.

Even with all the well deserved comcast hate here, it's probably true that it's the fastest provider on average for things like speedtest.

Comcast also sets themselves up as test points in many cities as well. When connecting to them from them, they have complete control over the network performance. They also KNOW you are accessing speedtest when you do it.

I know PC Magazine voted my ISP, Midcontinent Communications, as the nation's fastest. I'm assuming the amount of people you serve is a factor because of providers like Google Fiber, but MidCo is pretty fucking awesome. Their customer service is top of the line and they are getting Gigabit within a couple years here. They've already got the fiber network and their "basic" package is 60/10 for $50/month so no complaints.

And no military spending for a year.  It all goes to fusion.  No drug war, no more prisons.  No criminal convictions for a year.  Just fines - which go to fusion.

As an attorney, reading this piece of "journalism," and the underlying article about the original operation was deeply frustrating: "attorney a says its legal," "unnamed attorney b also said it was legal and common," "attorney c, who defends such cases, said his clients are innocent." WTF is this, CNN? How about you cite the code or statute it violates, or leave the writing to a more qualified journalist. 

>New York attorney Joseph Potashnik informed me that in federal cases this kind of conduct by law enforcment is legal. He wasn’t alone.

>An attorney who preferred not to be named remarked that it was not only legal, but it was “abused by the government on a regular basis” in other cases he’s tried, citing an officer that committed a sex act with a prostitute and then charged her with prostitution.

>Oddly enough, he wasn’t the only attorney to use that reference.

>Others, like attorneys Mark McBride and Norm Pattis disagreed. According to McBride, who has defended these types of cases before, “It’s definitely not legal.”

>Attorney Christopher Eskew noted that it wasn’t legal, but it wouldn’t be a case the US government would prosecute.

>In short, there isn’t a clear answer as to the legality of what the FBI did.

I hate when people throw out the word "hacker" as a general all around term for technology based villainy. That said, this PR says that they're going after people who violated the TOS by tricking the system to not cap data once they reached their plan's cap. The 2TB case is probably so miniscule that it doesn't matter.

This was **never** going to become a massive issue for T-Mobile, and I think its dumb that John Legere would even frame this as some network threatening stunt. He damn well sure shouldn't be running around saying that T-Mobile got "hacked". They should have been dealt with as just going after people who violated the TOS.

ITT: people misunderstanding the difference between the unlimited data promised to their phone and the ~~free~~ included tethering data allotment that has always been limited (with one exception). 

Tethering is a free data allotment designed to be shared with another device like a computer or tablet. You purchased unlimited data for the phone and get X amount to share. This is not unreasonable lest you have one phone in a house running 5 other devices. 

Also on those thinking that prioritization is throttling here is a reply I made earlier:

>To clarify, unlimited is not throttled. If someone uses more than 21gb consistently *and* the tower they are connected to is congested, the tower will simply say "wait". It is the towers way of organizing high traffic, you get the same issue when going to a restaurant. There is plenty of food, they aren't denying service, but there are only so many tables in that location so they say "wait". 

>The data itself is not a commodity, rather the cell towers have an inherent limitation. Each tower can only have so many sectors active at once. If the tower isn't busy, there is no "wait" whether you've used 3gb or 300gb...

Edit 1 -

The reason for all this:

>Limiting tether is not wrong. Wireless internet providers cannot and will not replace home ISP anytime soon. A tower can only have so many sectors active at once. Sure the data itself isn't a commodity, but the flow of it is. If you want to complain that this an infrastructure problem, you're incorrect. In each market, every provider has to purchase their own spectrum (bands) to operate on and the FCC regulates this to maintain a fair market. Each wireless communication company only had so many mhz to operate on in any given area. 

>TL;DR - wireless networks have an inherent limitation on bandwidth that will never allow them to overtake the wired ISP market

Everybody is missing the point.  

This ruling sets a legal prescient that a patent holder can be awarded all profits from all sales of an entire product if even a minor design feature in the product in infringing.  

This is every patent troll's wildest wet dream.  Imagine being able to sue Ford for all of their profits on every car they sold because they used a lug nut that has a similar shape to one that you patented.  

This is why all of the big tech companies filed briefs to stop the appeals court from affirming this ruling.

2305 :: ​Apple wins symbolic Samsung US ban - but faces backlash from tech gi...
> A US court has banned Samsung from selling software that makes its smartphones infringe on three Apple patents, including its 'slide to unlock' patent, one for predictive text, and another 'autocorrect' patent.
As noted by Foss Patents blogger Florian Mueller, the ruling only applies to software found on Samsung's older smartphones and so delivers Apple little advantage, other than a victory for its lawyers, who have long sought an injunction of the type awarded.
As Mueller points out, the autocorrect patent is set to expire in 10 days' time, whereas the court has given Samsung a month to comply with the injunction.

>Meanwhile, Apple's slide-to-unlock patent may still be held invalid and the only devices covered by the injunction were Samsung's Admire, Galaxy Nexus, and Stratosphere but not its flagship Galaxy Note and Galaxy S.
"So Samsung can still provide the functionality by simply avoiding the implementation it used in its oldest products. If the patent is indeed held invalid, then Samsung can also use the older implementations, but it presumably won't even be interested in that," he noted.

What is the point of a patent? It is to make the implementation of the idea is fully documented so that it may be used freely once the patent has expired. In exchange for this transparency, the patent filer is compensated with exclusive rights to implement this idea and rights to royalties from others who use it. 

In the case of "Slide to Unlock," there is no need for the technology behind it to be made public since it is unbelievably simple to implement. In addition, the cost of research to come up with this idea is marginally zero.

How this feature was successfully filed as a patent is beyond me.

It heavily favors big corporate interests. It allows them to abuse it with automated take down requests which can take days or weeks to contest, and when you contest them, they can just deny your request and pretty much have little recourse. It allows them to be very heavy handed about not allowing for any legitimate fair use, and in some cases can cause the actual rights holder to have to spend inordinate amounts of time on their claim. For example, NASA had video taken down by DMCA because a youtube news video used their free to use footage in their news article and their bot detected a match in NASA's video and issued an automated DMCA takedown on it. Its so easy to abuse like this and contesting a takedown is orders of magnitude harder and more expensive than the takedown itself. And guess who has a bigger legal department.

I'm a small content creator and DMCAs have protected my work in the past.  I don't need to hire a lawyer, I can write a letter, point to my website - say I own it.  Viola - takedown.

There should be a penalty for false claims - I agree with that.   There needs to be accountability.  

Flat out saying it's a bad thing - automatic FREE copyright protection with a simple complaint and liability procedure - is great for content creators who can't afford to pay for copyright protection on every single image and document that they create.

PLUS - there needs to be more respect for fair use as well.   Educational and journalistic use, plus use of copyrighted video and audio within the fair use guidelines must be respected - with liability for content providers who do damage to livelihoods based on misinterpretation or denial of our fair use rights.

It would be a wonderful place if we all played by the rules.

If you invest dozens of hours in making something - how do you feel if you see someone else using your hard work - making money on it - and not even giving you credit for the work you created.

I'll tell you exactly how it feels.   

**It sucks.**

**TL:DR:** If you think the DMCA and DMCA takedowns are 100% bad - how'd you like to do a week of work and not get a paycheck for it?   That's how it feels to have someone else use and make money off of your work.  DMCA takedown, unabused CAN and HAVE helped small content creators.
